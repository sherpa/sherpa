"""
Check that we support PHA2 data sets (this is a format used by Chandra
to represent the multiple orders - and potentially - arms of a
grating dataset).

At present most of the specialized handling of PHA2 files is found in
the sherpa.astro.ui module, which is why the tests are placed here.

It is also a place to test the handling of multiple datasets, in
particular backgrounds, since even the PHA1 versions of the grating
data have two background components.
