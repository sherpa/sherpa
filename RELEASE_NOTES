Details
-------

#1396 - XSPEC minimum version is now 12.10.1
    Bump the minimum-supported version of XSPEC from 12.9.0 to 12.10.1.
    (superseded by #1609)

#1472 - tests: remove work-around for #1334 from #1336
    Remove a test work around for our CI tests failing (issue #1334)

#1486 - Improve filtering/grouping behavior
    Changing the grouping array of a PHA dataset (with set_grouping from the UI layer
    or by setting the grouping attribute of a DataPHA object) will now re-create the
    filter, to fix #1160.
    It is suggested that the filter expression (e.g. as returned by the get_filter
    routine for uses of the UI layer) is checked to ensure the result is still sensible.

#1502 - Cleanup template code
    Improve the documentation and testing of the template-model code. There is no
    significant change in behavior, but some use cases will generate more-appropriate
    errors than they used to.

#1591 - Document params and return values for root finding functions
    Add docstrings for root finding functions

#1607 - Fix an issue when binning values into a 1D histogram
    Fix a problem when binning data into a histogram (issue #1605).

#1609 - XSPEC minimum version is now 12.12.0
    Bump the minimum supported XSPEC version to version 12.12.0.

#1611 - Post 4.15.0 updates
    Add the 4.15.0 DOI to the README.md.

#1613 - Allow testing of the documentation
    Adds the ability to run doctests in py and rst files. Those tests will run
    automatically, if doctestplus is installed (not on CI in the current setup) and
    the file is not explicitly blacklisted for doctestplus.

#1621 - Fix a cache error with TableModel
    Fix cache errors with the TableModel class (#1622), add validation of input
    values, and minor additions to the documentation.

#1630 - Add support for XSPEC 12.13.0
    Add explicit support for XSPEC 12.13.0. Sherpa can be built against XSPEC
    12.13.0 without this PR, but this adds in support for the new cglumin
    convolution model added in this release.

#1637 - report the filter changes when grouping is changed for the ui
    Report the filter when data is grouped with UI commands - such as group,
    group_counts, and set_grouping - to match the notice/ignore behavior added in
    #1562. The logic for setting the background group flag has been moved from the
    UI layer to the DataPHA class. Addresses #1632.

#1644 - Deployments via GH Actions
    Dropped support for RH7 and macOS 10.15

#1656 - CIAOX deployments require force. As they deployed for main already.
    Based on the current scheme used for the build number, we need to force uploads
    for CIAOX as they have already been deployed for main. This was already done for
    the previous GitLab builds.

#1660 - Associated group fixes
    Clean up of the notice/ignore and group/ungroup code to avoid unnecessary work,
    move logic from the UI layer into the DataPHA class, and ensure that if the
    grouping field is set to None that the data is not grouped. Fix #1641, #1657,
    and #1659

#1662 - Add grouping tests
    Add a number of tests to check out corner case behavior, primarily for grouping
    PHA data but there's also a number of routines from the UI code that have missed
    some tests.

#1664 - Allow save_model/source/resid to work with 2D data (fix #1642)
    Fix save_model/source/resid calls when used with 2D data sets. Fix #1642

#1665 - Fix an issue with show_bkg (fix #1645)
    The show_bkg routine could fail when the set of backgrounds is not the same for
    all datasets (e.g. one has a background and another does not). Fix #1645

#1666 - model-wrapped symbols now reference the actual model (fix #215)
    Wrapped models, accessible from the UI layer, now reference the wrapped model
    rather than being devoid of any useful information. Fix #215

#1672 - models: f-string changes
    Change the models code to use f-strings where appropriate rather than other methods
    of string interpolation. There is no change in behavior.

#1675 - Bump ds9 to 8.4.1 - Ubuntu 20 and macOS BigSur
    Bump to the latest DS9 version and update to ubuntu20 version. This resolves #1674

#1676 - update model macro definitions for compiled code
    Re-work the macro definitions used to build the compiled models and use this to
    clean up the handling of the XSPEC models, in particular table models. There is
    no functional change.

#1681 - XSPEC test cleanup
    Minor clean up to some XSPEC tests to make better use of pytest.

#1689 - Address regression created by #1672
    Internal change to the Sherpa-specific logging code, to ensure that logged
    message includes all components. This fixes #1688 which was a regression created
    when #1672 was recently merged.

#1693 - Test cleanup related to #1334
    Complete the cleanup related to removing the #1334 workaround which was added in
    #1336. These two tests were missed from #1472 (which was meant to remove these
    changes). The two test files have also seen some minor style changes (no change
    in behavior).

#1696 - Docs: fix #1694
    Correct a link in the RTD documentation.

#1697 - Ds9 test tweaks
    Minor cleanup of the DS9 tests (no functional change)

#1698 - Update versioneer to 0.28
    Update the version of versioneer included in Sherpa from 0.21 to 0.28. Fix #1677.

#1708 -Ensure string id can be used for the background id in the DataPHA notice/ignore call
    Allow a string identifier to be used for the bkg_id argument to the
    DataPHA.notice (and ignore) method, fixing #1709 (it does not affect users
    using the ui layer).

#1711 - plot: add linewidth option
    Add the linewidth option for line and histogram plots (e.g. plot_data,
    plot_model, plot_fit) with the matplotlib backend.

#1715 - utils: rework the error-column saving code
    Internal clean up of the save_*error routines. There is no change in behavior.

#1716 - utils: tweak internal _save_type routine
    Minor internal change to a routine in the utils code. There is no change in
    behavior.

#1720 - Fix get_stat_info output for individual components
    Fix the get_stat_info output for multiple PHA data when the data has a different
    number of background components (fix #1721). The get_bkg_model routine will now
    use the source PHA for a response if the background has no response (to match
    what fit and fit_bkg do, fix #1724).

#1733 - Allow fake_pha to be called with a list of ARF/RMF names of length 1
    Allow fake_pha to be called with a list of ARF and RMF names that only contains
    one element. Fix #1722

#1739 - pyfits: be more lenient with FITS files with messed-up headers
    Allow some FITS files with an invalid header to be used with the AstroPy I/O
    backend.

#1747 - reduce chance of plot_pvalue getting stuck in a bad parameter space
    Ensure that each simulation step for the likelihood ratios code, as used by
    plot_pvalue, starts with the same parameter values to reduce the chance that the
    results can get stuck in certain areas of parameter space. The ratios field of
    the LikelihoodRatioResults structure - e.g. the return value of
    get_pvalue_results() - can be plotted to see if this has happened (e.g. large
    ranges where the ratio is close to zero.

#1751 - Explicitly require attrs module when testing Sherpa
    Ensure that the attrs module is available for testing Sherpa.

#1752 - Drop Python 3.8 and Pick up Python 3.11 as a beta
    move to be NEP-29 compliant with python version

#1753 - Initial support for Python 3.11
    Basic support of Python 3.11.

#1755 - Tests: replace use of attrs package by dataclass
    Change a test file to use data classes rather than use the attrs module, which
    means that attrs is no-longer needed to test Sherpa. There is no functional
    change in this PR.

#1756 - Fix broken URL in docs
    Updated URLS which are no longer valid

#1759 - updated plot_pvalue docs
    Updated docstring for plot_pvalue to include reference to the algorithm

#1760 - Tweak test tolerances mac arm
    Improve test reliance when running on the macOS ARM platform

    Ensure the language setting is defined for recent versions of Sphinx

#1594 - gitlab-ci: Set build num to 0 if not set
    Set the default Sherpa build number to 0 in our GitLab workflow to know which
    package to run deploy tests on for official release builds.

#1600 - Change the histogram1d and 2d routines so that they do not sort the input arguments
    Address some failures in histogram1d and histogram2d routines by making sure
    they copy the input arguments before sorting them.

Caveats
-----------

* There are known issues (#1602, #1605, #1606) in the histogram1d/histogram2d functions
    leading to failures which were not fully addressed in this release (see the failed
    case in the second histogram1d example). This is not the Sherpa core functionality
    and numpy.histogram can be used if needed.

    Ensure we test a number of corner cases related to data validation.

#1484 - Include ciao region patch
    Allow the CXC Data Model library to be used to parse region files, if available. 
    This is primarily intended for building Sherpa as part of CIAO.

#1485 - get_header_data is an official method of the astro.io backend
    An internal change to make sure that the get_header_data routine is part of the 
    astro I/O backend API.

#1490  - Basic support for XSPEC 12.12.1
    Allow Sherpa to be built with XSPEC 12.12.1. It does not provide access to the three
    new models - polconst, pollin, and polpow - added in this release of XSPEC.

#1492 - Make tests pass on 3.10
    One of the tests fails in Python 3.10 because the error message has been changed.

#1493  - Remove deprecated distutils.version.LooseVersion
    The distutils.version.LooseVersion class is now marked as deprecated so remove its
    use when building Sherpa and when importing the Sherpa XSPEC module.

#1494 - Update AX_PYTHON_DEVEL.m4 from serial 17 to 25
    This update covers the cleanup of distutils in the configure files for grplib (and 
    stklib in the case of standalone sherpa).

#1495 - Note that we support Python 3.10
    Note that Sherpa can be built using Python 3.10 and add two Python 3.10 CI test runs.

#1496 -  DS9 update from 8.2.1 to 8.3
    Update to use ds9 v8.3 since v8.2.1 is no longer available

    Ensure that our tests can run on CI cleanly.


Sherpa 4.14.0
=============
This release of Sherpa includes various documentation updates,  bug fixes, enhancements, and infrastructure changes.

* enhancements:
    * filtering and grouping  for binned (1D) spectral data have been improved 
      with changes to the default behavior and many bug fixes resulting in 
      differences to the statistics, degrees-of-freedom and energy flux in 
      comparison to the previous version for the same data with the same filter.
    * the output of get_filter() for 2D region filter expressions now correctly 
      describe complicated shapes (e.g. when used with calc_data_sum2d)
    * updates allowing to change the hard limits of XSPEC model parameters and 
      also to use XSPEC models that use “out-of-bounds” values to switch certain 
      behaviour such as for example the fpl parameter of the xsoptxagn model
    * the sample_flux routine now returns correct information for the clip column
* documentation changes:
    * improved PHA simulation documentation 
    * improved Filtering and grouping of PHA data documentation
    * added sherpa.image module documentation
    * added section on running tests to developer docs
* Infrastructure Changes:
    * updates to support Apple ARM
    * update to support Xspec version 12.12 
    * update fftw from version 3.3.8 to 3.3.9
    * clean up of compiler and sphinx warnings
    * changes to support gcc 9.3.0 in conda defaults
    * updates to support python 3.9 including readline 8.1 upgrade, numpy minimum 1.19 (numpy 1.18 minimum for python 3.7/8)
    * test infrastructure clean up and updates
* bug fixes:
    * updates to fix several 'unable to parse region string: None' errors
    * fix issue where save_all() of a loaded image with no region filter would fail on reload
    * fixed issue with plot_model() being called before notice or ignore could lead to filters not getting applied
    * fix to error out instead of crash when grouping data using an unsupported method 

Details
-------

#1031 - Update fwhm calculation
    Update the estimation of FWHM for 1D profiles, and hence the guess method for 
    Gauss1D and related routines. The 2D models use the same routine so see these 
    changes.

#1073 - Allow fake_pha to be called with an identifier of None
    The fake_pha command now treats id=None as the default id. This addresses #1064.

#1106 - The sample_flux routine now returns the correct information for the clip column
    The sample_flux routine now returns correct information for the clip column
    (that is, it matches the clipping done by this routine). There may be changes to 
    the reported error ranges because of this change.

#1107 - Add some grating related keywords for _repr_html_ for ARF, RMF, PHA
    Add keywords to the default output in the _repr_html_ for some X-ray classes.

#1113 - XSPEC: support etable table models
    Allow XSPEC ETABLE table model files to be read by load_xstable_model by 
    setting the etable parameter.

#1118 - Improve test cases for source plots with PHA data
    Add additional test cases for source plots with PHA data to check out 
    rarely-used combinations.

#1127 - PHA filtering changes
    Improve some corner cases for filtering PHA data, including fixing #921 (channel
    bounds are integers, not half-integers).

#1131 - Test: fix a test failure when XSPEC installed but no fits backend
    Avoid running a test we know to fail for an uncommon combination of options.

#1134 - This is a doc-string only update for load_multi_XXX
    The previous example implied that a spectrum may contain both positive and 
    negative orders in the same spectrum. That can happen only after coadding - 
    and in that case one would co-add the arfs as well.

#1135 - Added docstring and removed unused no-op class
    Remove sherpa.astro.models.MultiResponseSumModel which did nothing and seems 
    to be unused (except in a test that explicitly skip this class).

#1136 - Replace error message "too few columns" with a more generic word
    Change the wording of an error message. Potentially breaking if someone tests 
    for the wording of the error message in their code, but certainly more correct.

#1137 - Correct docstring for fake_pha
    The old docstring claims that the background is just scaled and not simulated, 
    but there is definitely a call to poisson_noise for the background in the code.

#1138 - Address NumPy 1.20 bool/int/float deprecation warnings
    NumPy 1.20 notes that numpy.bool, numpy.int, and numpy.float will be removed 
    and users should just use bool, int, and float instead, so these symbols have 
    been changed. This is a follow on to #1092

#1140 - Fix some remaining master/main renames
    clean up references to master with main

#1143 - add basic test and documentation for Integrate1D
    Add basic testing of the integrate1d model class and improve its documentation.

#1144 - A minor cleanup of estmethods
    A minor cleanup of the sherpa.estmethods code.

#1147 - Tests: support use of data directory being local, not absolute
    Allow a test to pass when given a relative path for the test data directory.

#1154 - Update docs on RTD builds
    Update docs on how the docs are build in CI

#1155 - Remove Meta class for fits hdu headers
    Remove Meta class for header information that is used only rudimentary and 
    acts almost, but not quite, like a dict

#1163 - XMM/RGS triggers a notice/ignore bug because channels are in reverse-energy order in RMF
    Recent work on the ignore / notice logic in #1127 implicitly assumes that the 
    energy grid in PHA/ARF/RMF files is in increasing order, which does not hold 
    true for XMM/RGS data

#1164 - Fix plots with wavelength general:visualization type:bug
    For some data files, plots with a reversed grid (i.e. plots in wavelength) were 
    drawn with disjoint lines since #906.

#1165 - Add a section on running the tests to the developer docs
    Add a section on running the tests to the developer docs

#1168 - Logging tweaks
    Include the sherpa.utils.logging module in the documentation and update a test 
    to use the caplog feature of pytest (the code had been written to work with 
    python 2.7 version of unittest).

#1170 - Update Python and particularly number versions in documentation
    Updates to doc pages that list dangerously old numpy versions

#1171- Improve the grouping/filtering tests
    Add a number of tests for corner cases of filtering and grouping of PHA data.

#1172 - Improve data pha docs
    Improve the documentation of the filtering and grouping of PHA data.

#1173 - Improve DataPha documentation
    Minor improvements to the documentation of the DataPHA class.

#1175 - Store UI contour plots in a dictionary, not directly
    Change the internal storage handling of contour objects

#1177 - minor rework of image handling for ui layer
    Change the internal storage handling of image objects and improved testing

#1178 - Define physical constant hc in fewer places
    hc (as in "Planck constant * speed of light") is a physical constant that does 
    not depend on the DataPHA and thus it should not be defined as a class attribute.

#1180 - Minor improvements to model/parameter documentation
    Minor fixes and improvements to the documentation (both docstrings and RTD) 
    for the model- and parameter-related code.

#1182 - Simulations with multiple responses
    Enable simulations with multiple ARF/RMF present (e.g. LETG/HRC).

#1183 - Check parameter link behavior
    Minor tweaks to the parameter tests.

#1184 - Better pha model component plotting (fix #1020)
    The use of plot_model_component and get_model_component will now automatically 
    add the response for PHA data sets, if there is one. Model expressions which 
    contain a response will not be changed. Fixes #1020.

#1187 - Conda GCC 9.3.0 update issue
    update to support environment changes due to conda defaults updates for 
    gcc 9.3.0

#1192 - Remove Python 3.6 and add Python 3.9
    updates to switch python support to python 3.7-3.9

#1194 - datastack: Improve show_stack and add _repr_html_ for stack
    Improve datastack display (via show_stack and in the notebook) for datastacks.

#1198 - XSPEC test cleanup
    Very minor improvement to the XSPEC test suite.

#1199 - Move the regrid code out into a separate method
    Very minor code reorganization for the regrid code.

#1203 - Update GitLab Conda recipe to numpy 1.19
    updates gitlab conda recipe to python 1.19+ and adds run time pin

#1204 - region lib updates for CIAO 4.14
    updates to fold in changes to CIAO region lib for CIAO 4.14. Specifically, 
    fixes for SM-89: bug in pie shape (extent/inside logic), SL-243: region - 
    deprecate obsoleted Warning.

#1205 - Remove the SherpaTestCase class
    Remove the SherpaTestCase class from sherpa.utils.testing and switch the tests 
    that used it to use pytest functionality where appropriate.

#1208 - Fix get_xerr for Data1DInt when all data is filtered
    The get_xerr method of Data1DInt would fail if all bins had been ignored and 
    it now returns the empty list.

#1215 - Restrict the values used in PHA notice/filter calls
    Ensure that the low and high limits for notice and ignore calls for DataPHA 
    objects are sensible (hi >= lo and that for energy or wavelength filters they 
    are >= 0). When filtering DataPHA objects in channel units the lo and hi 
    arguments must be integers otherwise an error is raised.

#1216 - filter improvements for DataPHA and Data1DInt
    Energy and wavelength filters (with notice and ignore) for PHA data are now 
    treated as lo <= x < hi in all cases, and channel filters are lo <= x <= hi 
    (where the channel values must be integers). For Data1DInt cases the notice 
    and ignore filters are treated as lo <= x < hi. This changes address a number 
    of corner cases.
    This can result in slightly different fit results because the data used in the 
    fit can be changed and hence changing the number of degrees of freedom (by one 
    or two depending on whether the first and last bins have been removed).

#1218 - Update fftw from version 3.3.8 to 3.3.9
    This change updates the version of the fftw module in sherpa's external 
    dependencies (extern) directory to utilize version 3.3.9 (www.fftw.org) instead 
    of the previous version 3.3.8

#1219 - Fix filter expressions
    Filter expressions for Data1DInt and DataPHA cases now report the start and end 
    value of each set of grouped data rather than use the end points. For PHA data 
    sets users now see the same ranges displayed whether the data is grouped or not. 
    The actual filter remains the same even if the filter expressions has changed 
    slightly.

#1223 - XSPEC 12.12.0 support
    Support the new additive and multiplicative models in XSPEC 12.12.0 - XSgrbjet, 
    XSwdem, XSvwdem, XSvvwdem are additive and XSzxipab is multiplicative - and 
    note the additional abundance tables that are available when running with XSPEC 
    12.12.0 (lpgp and lpgs).

#1227 - Support AstroPy 4.3 for tests
    The AstroPy FITS reader is less tolerant of invalid FITS files in AstroPy 4.3 
    which trips one of our tests. The test has been updated with a FITS file that 
    doesn't trigger the error case. There is no functional change in this commit.

#1228 - Fix three parameter names for XSPEC models
    Fix three XSPEC models which had some internal confusion over parameter names: 
    XSzkerrbb should have uses fcol but had instead used hd, and XSzashift and 
    XSzmshift used Redshift instead of Velocity. The old names have been kept as 
    aliases.

#1230 - Update submodule to pick up submodule README
    Updates submodule to pick up the submodule README

#1231 - Remove __init__.py from tests directory
    Clean up of a test directory. There is no functional change in this commit.

#1236 - Remove compiler warnings
    Avoid compiler warnings from clang, fixing #1232 and several other warnings.

#1241 - to get sherpa to run Apple M1 (arm)
    Initial support of sherpa for ARM build 

#1244 - Fix "unable to parse region string: None" errors (issue #1214)
    In certain circumstances (such as plot_pvalue with an explicit 2D PSF 
    convolution operator read from a file) the code would fail with the error 
    unable to parse region string: None (issue #1214). This PR fixes this problem 
    and several minor related issues.

#1246 - Image region filters are now specified correctly (Fix #1245)
    Update the image filter code so that the region description matches what the 
    filter actually is: rather than use & to combine regions we now use | as it 
    is a logical or rather than logical and. This is mainly going to affect users 
    who: have used the output of get_filter() as input to calc_data_sum2d, have 
    very-complex spatial filters, or are restoring Sherpa sessions created by save 
    or save_all.

#1247 - Allow save_all to work well with images with no filters (Fix #437)
    Fix a problem with the output of the save_all command if an image had been 
    loaded but no region filter applied (fix #437): the output file would contain 
    a notice2d_id call with a filter of "" which would fail if you tried to load 
    the file back in. It now no-longer creates this line.

#1248 - Docs: note that set_stat can be sent a stats object
    Update the documentation for set_stat to note you can send in a stats object

#1250 - Stop odd interaction between plot_model and PHA filters (Fix #1024)
    plot_model(), if done before calling notice or ignore, could lead to strange 
    filters (e.g. filter not getting applied). This has been fixed. Fixes #1024

#1253 - More numpy 1.20 warning fixes
    Avoid warnings from NumPy 1.20 about using the deprecated np.int symbol.

#1254 - FIX: #1235 change XSPEC chatter to 10 from 0
    Change the default X-Spec chatter level from 0 to 10. This may result in screen 
    output the first time an XSPEC model is evaluated (e.g. from a plot_model or 
    fit call). There have been a number of cases where APEC models appeared to be 
    creating no output because of missing data files (due to old ~/.xspec/Xspec.init 
    settings) which would have been more obvious with this change. To get back to 
    the previous behavior users can call set_xschatter(0).

#1259 - XSPEC parameter changes - you can change the hard limits of most XSPEC parameters
    XSPEC model parameters now use the same limits for soft and hard (the hard 
    limit from the model.dat file). This is handled by the XSBaseParameter class 
    which is used for XSPEC table models. The XSParameter class, which extends this 
    and is used by most other parameters, allows the user to change the hard limits 
    of the model. This follows XSPEC, and allows using some models which are 
    documented as supporting a value outside the normal parameter range (normally 
    by setting the value to a negative value). Note that this is potentially 
    dangerous (it could crash the program) so should be used carefully. It is 
    strongly suggested that any parameter set to a value outside of the original 
    limits is also frozen.

#1260 - Add a module to parse XSPEC model.dat and helper scripts #1260
    Add support for parsing XSPEC model.dat files (useful for updating the XSPEC 
    module or if you want to use XSPEC local models).

#1261 - update to match recent XSPEC model.dat settings
    Update the XSPEC models to match the latest model.dat file (from HEASOFT 6.29 / 
    XSPEC 12.12.0). This primarily changes the hard limits of the models, but there 
    are some changes to the default parameter values as well, as well as some unit 
    changes, including adding and removing units.

#1264 - Fix crash from grouping data using an unsupported method
    It was possible to cause Sherpa to crash by passing an invalid function as the 
    groupfunc argument to apply_filter and apply_group. The code now errors out 
    instead. There are improvements to the documentation (docstring and RTD) for 
    PHA filtering and grouping.

#1268 - Doc: switch default sphinx role
    Multiply the number of working references on readthedocs, while at the same 
    time reduce verbosity in the docstrings.

#1270 - Cleanup setup
    Update the Python supported status in the package metadata (drop 3.5, add 3.8) 
    and bump the minimum version to 3.6.

#1273 - crates backend strip preceding/trailing whitespace when determining ascii file colnames (Fix #1262)
    This change modifies the crates backend ascii file handling to resolve issue 
    #1262 where a test added in PR #1253 causes the tests to fail. This change may 
    potential result in behavior changes for crates use on ascii data files (see 
    caveat section for details).

#1276 - Fix Inconsistent behavior in save_arrays when optional parameter ascii = True/False (Fixes issue #1251)
    Updates the data I/O so that write_arrays behaves consistently whether writing 
    ascii or fits files via the pyfits backend.

#1279 - rm the platform cause no longer need it
    rm the platform module since it is not needed for ARM support

#1281 - RTD: include parse_xspec_model_description
    Fix a link on the Read The Docs pages from PR #1260

#1282 - Add Zenodo details for 4.13.1
    Include the Zenodo details for the 4.13.1 release into the hard-coded list of 
    releases.

#1285 - Added an option to reflect minim about the boundary
    This PR adds the option on how the optimization minim will behave if the free 
    parameter is beyond the limit. The default parameter reflect is True (will 
    reflect by an equal amount about the limit). If reflect is set to False then 
    model function will return DBL_MAX (~1e308) and therefore it will not be 
    included in the simplex.

#1287 - Remove C++ warning when compiling the pileup code
    Use unique_ptr rather than auto_ptr in the pileup code to avoid C++ warnings. 
    Fix #505

#1288 - Improve the PHA simulation documentation
    Fix up some links in the RTD documentation for simulating PHA data.

#1290 - Fix the string output of CDFPlot
    Corrected the order of the points, x, and y values when displaying a CDFPlot 
    object, improve support for a list argument, and made minor additions to the 
    documentation in the sherpa.plot module.

#1291 - Comment: add link to the OSTI.GOV URL for the optimizing document
    Add a reference to the OSTI.GOV technical report in the comments in the C++ 
    code used for testing the optimization functions.

#1292 - Update tests that were changed by #1246
    Fix tests that started to fail once #1246 was merged.

#1293 -RTD: add a "how to optimize a function" example
    Add a section to the ReadTheDocs site explaining how to "optimize a function" 
    as this is something we can do but only really with the low-level code.

#1294 - RTD: Fix some sphinx warnings (sherpa.models.regrid)
    Fix a minor warning when generating the Read The Docs pages.

#1295 - Update XSkerrconv model for #1275
    Rename the first two parameters of the XSPEC XSkerrconv convolution model from 
    Index/Index1 to Index1/Index2. Fixes #1275

#1296 - Document the neldermead reflect flag from #1285
    Add documentation for the reflect keyword added in #1285 for the neldermead 
    optimizer

#1303 - Updated Introductory Section of the MCMC page
    Added additional details regarding sherpa's MCMC inplementation to the 
    documentation 

#1308 - Docs: fix get_filter examples
    Fix the examples in the get_filter documentation.

#1310 -Update the python check for python setup.py installs to 3.7
    Updates the minimum supported version of python supported in setup.py to use 
    python 3.7

Caveats
-----------

* Crates behavior change - PR #1273 fixes an issue with the crates backend where 
    supplying a column filter "opt colnames=none" for an ascii file would utilize 
    default column names 'col1..coln' instead of the column names specified in the 
    file.  Code which relied on the old behavior may now produce an IO error such 
    as "IOErr: Required column 'col1' not found in [ <list of valid column names>]"

Details
-------

#754 - sample_flux now returns statistic values for each row
    The sample_flux command now returns a statistic value for each iteration, 
    even if those rows are not used in the reported flux distribution. Fixes #751.

#769 - add basic cache tracking
    Adds the cache_status and cache_clear methods to models for verifying the 
    cache behavior (this is only expected to be used in rare cases). The cache 
    code has seen documentation improvements.

#946 - rework stats tests
    Update the stats tests to use pytest.

#960 - Fix model evaluation when changing the integrate setting (fix #958)
    Fixes an issue with cache evaluation on 1D models using integrated bins and 
    the user has changed the integrate setting of the model.

#978 - Use C99 def for INFINITY, NAN, isfinite and isnan to build on aarch64 (fix issue #970)
    Use the math constants (IFINITIY, NAN) and funcs (isfinite, isnan, signbit) 
    from a C99 compliant compiler if the compiler option -std=c99 or greater is 
    used, otherwise use the quantities as defined by the library.

#991 - lint changes
    Applies a number of flake8-reported warnings to the code base (e.g. excessive 
    or missing spaces and new lines).

#1000 - Improve sherpa.citation (fix #994 #987)
    Fixes the sherpa.citation() command with its default argument (issue #994) and 
    adds release 4.12.2 to the hard-coded list of releases. A typo in a warning 
    message was fixed (#987).

#1001 - Allow command-line arguments for sherpa_test
    Allow command-line arguments to be passed to the sherpa_test script. This allows 
    running optional tests (e.g. the --runzenodo argument) and to configure the 
    pytest configuration (e.g. to run coverage checks with --cov sherpa).

#1002 - Fix error with clobber=False for paging - issue #996
    Fix an error with clobber=False when the output file exists for several paging 
    commands (e.g. show_data and sherpa.citation). Instead of getting a Sherpa IOErr 
    being raised a NameError was being raised.

#1003 - Fix serialization of iter method data - issue #997
    If set_iter_fit_method has been called with a value other than 'none' then the 
    output of save_all would be incorrect for the options for the iter-fit method.

#1004-  flake8 F811 - fix repeated test names
    Clean up of several test files to fix repeated test names.

#1005 - Add explicit get/set_datadir routines to sherpa.utils.testing
    Internal changes to how the test data directory location is set and queried, 
    including removing direct support from SherpaTestCase. Added tests for some 
    of this functionality, and updated several test files to remove SherpaTestCase 
    or use the new datadir functionality.

#1008 - rm warning msgs, fix issue #980
    Fix the compiler warning messages, by defining kwlist to be static const then 
    use the C++ const_cast to remove the const to conform to PyArg_ParseTupleAnd
    Keywords prototype

#1012 - Tests: allow test_ui tests to be run with pytest-xdist
    Allow the tests to be run with pytest-xdist.

#1016 - Jupyter notebook representation not ideal if model components don't have unique names  - issue: #1013
    Fix an error in the HTML display of a model (used in the notebook) when two 
    model components have the same name.

#1017 - reword remark on normalization of Lorentz function
    Updated the comments pertaining to Lorentz function for clarity

#1018 - Fix ShekelModifiedInit missing init par vals
    This PR fixes the missing initial fitted parameter values for the 
    ShekelModifiedInit function. A fix for issue #1011

    Corrects issue building with gcc 7.3.0+ compilers with the 
    -Werror=format-security compilation flag

#1034 - Add contextmanager and docs on how to control the output level of sherpa
    Sherpa uses logging for much of its output, this adds a docs and a context 
    manager for controlling the output level for a particular piece of code.

#1039 - Add docs for basic.TableModel
    Added missing documentation for TableModel class 

#1049 - CI: pip submodule test to report coverage
    Report the coverage data from the pip CI run. This only changes the GitHub 
    Actions runs.

#1053 - Release 4.13.0
    Updates to support the 4.13.0 release

#1054 - Post 4.13.0 updates
    Updates the Zenodo DOI reference in the README.md to include 4.13.0.

#1057 - Fix plot_source clearwindow setting
    The plot_source function was ignoring the clearwindow parameter (always using 
    True) in calls to plot_source for non-PHA data. This was only for 
    sherpa.astro.ui.plot_source (so sherpa.ui.plot_source did not have this problem).

#1058 - Store the opstr of model combinations (unary and binary)
    Store the operator string as well as the operator when creating the unary and 
    binary operator expressions for models.

#1062 - Minor code cleanup of sherpa.astro.ui.utils
    The sherpa.astro.ui.utils module has seen a number of minor clean-ups, addressing 
    pylint-reported issues.

#1067 - Improve testing of sherpa.astro.ui.utils
    Improve coverage of the sherpa.astro.ui.utils and require pytest 3.9.0 or later 
    for testing Sherpa.

#1068 - clean up typos in sherpa/plot code
    Fixed several typos noticed while reviewing plot related fix for #1057

#1072 - Update load_data to match load_pha for PHA2 data
    Ensure that load_data behaves like load_pha when given a PHA2 dataset.

#1076 - sample_flux now uses the id argument
    The sample_flux routine now uses the id argument rather than always using the 
    data from the default dataset. Fixes #752

#1078 - Add error checking for exceptional cases for sample_flux
    Ensure that sample_flux errors out if the Xrays argument is False (as this code 
    path is currently broken) or if the confidence argument is invalid.

#1082 - Improve documentation for notice2d
    Minor improvements to the documentation of notice2d and ignore2d set of commands. 
    Fixes #1059

#1086 - Use the logging infrastructure for sample_flux output
    The screen output from sample_flux is now generated by the Sherpa logger and 
    so can be hidden by the user if required.

#1088 - Allow two optimization test to pass
    Address an issue in the optimization tests that meant two tests were failing. 
    This only changes the test code and makes no change to the behavior of the 
    optimizers.

#1092- Numpy 1.20 warnings
    Avoid test failures due to new warnings added by NumPy 1.20

#1094 - Cleanup multi-plot code
    Rework the code that handles the plot_fit_xxx and plot_bkg_fit_xxx calls. 
    There should be no user-visible changes.

#1096 - Reduce direct access to plot objects
    Changes to the internals of the plot code, to access information via methods 
    rather than direct access, which improves encapsulation and reduces code 
    repetition.

#1098 - Bump DS9 version to 8.2 for CI
    Bump DS9 version used in CI tests from 8.1 to 8.2.

#1100 - Address reg_proj and reg_unc failures (fix #1093)
    Calls to reg_proj and reg_unc could error out when the min or max arguments 
    were set to tuples rather than lists. The code now converts these attributes 
    to lists, which can result in changes to the string output of the objects (use 
    of '[]' brackets rather than '()'). Fixes #1093

#1101 - Address upper limit issues with sample_flux (fix #457)
    sample_flux no-longer excludes samples at the parameter bounds (soft) when 
    calculating the flux distribution. This could lead to an over-estimation of 
    the flux for upper limits (Fix #457).

#1104 - Add basic documentation for the low-level optimization code
    Add and update documentation on the interfaces used by the low-level 
    optimization code. Ensure that the plot classes are fully included in the 
    documentation.

#1105 - Consolidate and harmonize the validation of dataset identifiers
    Simplify the code used to validate dataset identifiers. Several names can 
    no-longer be used as an identifier ('astrocompmodel', 'astrocompsource', 
    'astrodata', 'astromodel', 'astrosource', 'model_component', and 
    'source_component') and two can now be used ('energy' and 'photon').

#1108 - Read RMFs where N_CHAN is an array
    Allow the pyfits backend to read a wider range of RMF files

#1111 - Minor test updates
    Minor updates to the test code, including a small enhancement to the tests run by 
    the smoke_test command.

#1112: XSPEC: require model evaluation to be sent low and high grid values
    XSPEC model classes must now be evaluated with bin edges - that is with 
    low,high bins. The support for sending in a single grid and treating it a 
    consecutive set of bins has been marked as deprecated from the model class 
    interface. This feature is still supported for anyone evaluating the models 
    directly from the sherpa.astro.xspec._xspec module or via the _calc method.

#1116: Add parameter-based tests for the PSF model
    Adds several tests of edge-case handling of parameters for PSF convolution models.

#1117 - Docs: improve cache discussion and documentation
    Improve the discussion of the cache support when evaluating models.

#1120 - Switch default branch to main
    Change the default branch from master to main. Also  includes minor documentation 
    updates (CONTRIBUTING.md updates to switch to main, to reference GitHub Actions 
    instead of Travis, and to remove a note about Python 3.5 support).

#1121- Hide AstroPy 4.2.1 FITS-related warnings
    astropy.io.fits.open now creates warning messages about invalid FITS structures 
    when given a non-FITS file. This updated hides those warning messages since 
    routines such as sherpa.astro.io.load_data attempts to open files (including ascii 
    files) as FITS. 

#1122 - Update ds9 download
    Update DS9 tests to use ubuntu18 and darwinhighsierra as ubuntu14 and darwinsierra 
    are no longer supported. The DS9 version has been bumped from 8.2 to 8.2.1 as this 
    is the latest version.

#1125: Support Matplotlib 3.4
    Matplotlib 3.4 changes how the drawstyle argument is handled in some functions. 
    This change removes the use of this argument for those functions.

#1126 - Tweak plot docs
  Adds a new notebook that shows off a number of plots created with matplotlib and 
  exports the ScatterPlot, TracePlot, CDFPlot, PDFPlot, and LRHistogram classes from 
  sherpa.plot.

#1130: Fix save_data when the output file exists
    Fix problems when save_data is used with clobber=False but the output file already 
    exists. Fixes #1071

#1132 - Update XQuartz for GH Actions workflow
    Updates the xQuartz download location and version for the GitHub Actions Conda tests

#1139 - Fix typo in Zenodo test that made it fail
    Fixed a typo in the zenodo test which gets only run via the --runzenodo flag 

#1142 - Add instruction for source build on Mac
    Add instruction for source building on Mac that were previously only part of the 
    internal release notes.

Testing and infrastructure fixes are not shown.

#351 - fix handling of AREASCAL column in PHA files (fix #350)
    Adds support for handling the AREASCAL value (either scalar of vector) for PHA 
    data sets. This array is used in XMM RGS data to handle missing chips.

#385 - Properly handle Swift RMF when using Astropy backend
    Fixes an issue where some low lever xpa calls were returning byte strings rather 
    than strings in Python 3. This had particular impact on the image_getregion 
    function.

#483 - An initial release of simultaneous fit on multicores (slower for most…
    Distributes the evaluations of the multiple independent data sets using the 
    multi-cores built-in the user's workstation. The current default setting for this 
    PR is to evaluate the multiple independent data sets sequentially since the 
    overhead for distributing the workload across multi-cores is high if the evaluation 
    of the data sets is not time consuming.

#631 - Add HTML representations of common classes for IPython display (fix #345)
    An initial version of HTML display support for Sherpa objects for users of 
    IPython/Jupyter notebooks. 

#634 - Added invitation for native software citation
    Adds a citation method to the sherpa module and updates CITATION to refer to this 
    new functionality

#693 - Address matplotlib linestyle removal in Matplotlib version 3.3
    Matplotlib version 3.3 now requires you to split out the drawstyle and linestyle 
    arguments. This set of PRs changes the code so that the two arguments are now set: 
    linestyle defaults to solid and drawstyle to default for plots and step-mid for 
    histograms. This appears to replicate the old version, and should be backwards 
    compatible (drawstyle is supported in Matplotlib 2.2.5 and 1.5.3)

#709 - Residual-style plots ignore the ylog setting (fi#586)
    Residual, ratio, and delchi plots always use a linear scale for the y axis, no 
    matter what the ylog setting is.

#740 - resample_data: when the error range on a bin includes -1 and no-longer restrict 
       sampling to +/-1 sigma
    Fixes resample_data/ReSampleData so that it correctly handles bins where the range 
    of data values (i.e. low to high limit) includes the value -1.

#741 - Fix issue 638, guess needs to update fwhm/sigma bounds
    Adds support for guessing the fwhm or sigma parameters of the Gauss2D, 
    NormGauss2D, and SigmaGauss2D models

#750 - Add xspec convolution api
    Adds support for XSPEC convolution-style models - this link is valid for XSPEC 
    12.10.1 documentation

#765 - Add docs for setting up all dependencies of the source build with conda
    Adds documentation on how to use conda to install source build dependencies

#766 - No error for no-ops in `ungroup` and friends
    Removes DataErrs when ungrouping a dataset that is not grouped or unsubtracting 
    a dataset that was not subtracted

#770 - Replace EmissionVoigt/AbsorptionVoigt models by Voigt model (fix #597)
    Replaces the EmissionVoigt and AbsorptionVoigt models with a single model, 
    Voigt1D. The EmissionVoigt and AbsorptionVoigt models will error out when an 
    instance is created, pointing users to Voigt1D (as the parameter definitions 
    have changed).

#772 - Add XSPEC 12.11.0 support (HEAsoft 6.27)
    Adds support for XSPEC 12.11.0 (released March 31 2020)

#782 - Add a pyproject.toml file
    Adds a pyproject.toml file to the top level (PEP 518) to document build 
    requirements

#789 - fix issue #788, fit using moncar with verbose=1 and/or numcores!=1
    Fixes NameError in moncar when verbose setting >0

#791 - Fix ignore/notice erroring out when all bins have been set bad #790
    Allow notice and ignore to be called on a dataset which has no "good" bins 
    after ignore_bad has been called

#793 - Accept masked arrays for Data XXX creation
    Allows use the mask of numpy arrays when initializing DataXXX

#798 - enable regrid for the BinaryOpModel class
    Adds the regrid method to the BinaryOpModel. 

#803 - Updates to sampling of energy and photon fluxes: bug fixes and calculate 
       unabsorbed components
    Fixes and improvements to the energy_flux and photon_flux set of commands: 
    sample_energy_flux, sample_photon_flux, plot_energy_flux, plot_photon_flux, 
    get_energy_flux_hist, and get_photon_flux_hist

#811 - Remove all __future__ imports
    Removes __future__ imports that were in place when sherpa supported python 2

#812 - Add unsubtract and ungroup to datastack
    Adds  corresponding unsubtract and ungroup methods to match subtract and group

#815 - fix typo in rst docs
    Fixes a typo in the rst docs

#821 - Add hyperlink to similarly named SHERPA package
    Documentation update to include a link to the similarly named package "SHERPA" 
    for hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models

#842 - Fix scaling of staterror when reading PHA file with rate instead of counts
    Fixes scaling of STAT_ERR when reading a PHA spectra with a RATES column instead of 
    COUNTS

#845 - xspec table models: add out-of-bound check to avoid segfault
    Adds explicit out of bounds checks to avoid segv when calling an Xspec table model

#851 - Updates to the Read-The-Docs build environment
    Update the Read-The-Docs configuration to the latest version (2), and switch to a 
    cleaner build (using conda) for the documentation. The minimum Sphinx requirement is 
    now 1.8 (updated from 1.3).

#856 - Support setting the id value in load_pha with pha2 files (fix #666)
    Updates load_pha to set the data ids of PHA2 datasets  to: id to id + nfiles - 1 
    (when id is an integer), or "{}1".format(id) to "{}{}".format(id, nfiles) when id 
    is a string.

#858 - Minor documentation improvements to ReadTheDocs
    Adds minor updates to the convolution, regrid, and model evaluation sections of 
    the ReadTheDocs documentation

#859 - Clean up of the XSPEC interface code
    Internal changes to the XSPEC interface code, which reduces the amount of similar 
    (sometimes identical) code. There is no change to the behavior of the XSPEC models.

#865 - Minor documentation fixes
    Several documentation fixes: XSPEC parameter names, avoiding confusion over links on 
    references (Sphinx pages), and adding some basic documentation to the 
    sherpa.astro.background module

#866 - Add parameter-clipping strategy to routines that generate samples (fix #846)
    The addition of the clip parameter lets users control how parameter values are 
    clipped before use in sample_energy_flux, sample_photon_flux, plot_energy_flux, 
    plot_photon_flux, get_energy_flux_hist, and get_photon_flux_hist.

#868 - Add delete_pileup_model (fix #441), list_pileup_model_ids, list_psf_ids functions, 
       fix list_models (fix #749)
    Add the delete_pileup_model() function to allow a pileup model to be removed from 
    a fit (issue #441), and list_psf_ids() and list_pileup_model_ids() routines to list 
    those datasets with an associated PSF or pileup model. The list_models() routine 
    no-longer returns an iterator but a list when given an option (issue #749).

#871 - Add MacOS LDFLAGS warning to devdocs
    Copies the warning about setting PYTHON_LDFLAGS from the install page to the 
    developer docs

#884 - Move logic from ui layer to DataPHA class: background responses (fix #879, #880)
    Moves the logic for adding a background response, if one doesn't exist, from the UI 
    layer to the DataPHA class to clear up several edge cases

#888 - Support vector backscales and bugfix for background modeling
    Supports fitting backgrounds to PHA datasets which have a variable BACKSCAL array 
    (rather than a scalar), which can come from combining spectra (e.g. the CIAO contrib 
    script combine_spectra) or from the data extraction process. In doing so a number of 
    routines related to the scaling of background-to-source aperture data have seen 
    adjustments to behavior and some enhanced functionality (such as 
    sherpa.astro.ui.get_bkg_scale and the sherpa.astro.data.DataPHA.get_background_scale 
    method).

#897 - Add support for XSPEC 12.11.1
    Allows Sherpa to be built against XSPEC 12.11.1. There are no new or changed models 
    in this release compared to XSPEC 12.11.0.

#899 - Update likelihood descriptions
    Updates likelihood description in several doc-strings and clarifies descriptions 
    of statistics.

#900 - Ensure that 1D and 2D models are not combined in an expression.
    Checks that models have the correct dimensionality when combining them, so 
    expressions like gauss2d.src + const1d.bgnd will now raise a ModelErr.

#906 - Improve and add support for histogram plots
    Updates to the display of histogram-style plots, in particular for 1D integrated 
    datasets and some model display for PHA data. The histograms now cover the full 
    length of each bin (previously they only showed half the bin for the first and 
    last bins), and gaps in the histogram (where the high edge of a bin is less than 
    the lower edge of the next bin) are now correctly displayed.

#907 - FEATURE: support alpha transparency for matplotlib plots
    Supports the 'alpha' preference setting for most plots and contours generated 
    by Matplotlib

#909 - Refactor: remove _get_model/source methods
    Removes the _get_source and _get_model methods as they are the same as 
    get_source and get_model

#910 - Docs: fix several minor issues
    Documentation clean up - the load_template_interpolator function was named 
    incorrectly in the example, and the examples for 
    get_source_component_plot/get_model_component_plot were missing the trailing 
    _plot for the function names

#911 - Docstring: changes for ahelp
    Formatting changes to the docstrings for several routines that are useful for 
    SDS in generating ahelp files

#918 - fix an issue with PHA filtering that affects plot_model
    Fixes an issue when applying filters to generate the plot_model and 
    plot_model_component plots for PHA datasets

#919 - enable regrid for the BinaryOpModel class (rebased #798)
    Enables composite models (created by a binary operation between two models) to 
    be regridded. The composite model is evaluated at the new grid, and it is only 
    the combined model expression that is rebinned to the data grid.

#922 - channel settings with grouped PHA data and model plotting
    Fixes a bug when filtering a grouped PHA dataset using analysis=channel. The 
    selected bin ranges did not always match the versions you would have received 
    when doing the same operation with energy or wavelength analysis (the first or 
    last bin may have been different).

#924 - Updated to ignore the .vscode directory
    updates system .gitignore to skip over vscode directories

#929 - Support overplot option in plot_fit_xxx (issue #700)
    The overplot argument can now be used with the plot_fit_xxx and plot_bkg_fit_xxx 
    routines (e.g. plot_fit_ratio).

#931 - Update Data1DInt / DataPHA data plots to use the histogram plot style
    Switch the plot_data/plot_bkg plots to draw the data as histograms for Data1DInt 
    and DataPHA plots.  This will change the behavior of code that accesses the plot 
    data - e.g. get_data_plot() or the dataplot element of get_fit_plot() - since for 
    DataPHA and Data1DInt datasets the data will no-longer have an x attribute but 
    xlo and xhi. To reduce the need for code changes for existing scripts - as many 
    people use get_model_plot and get_data_plot to get the data - the histogram 
    plots will return (xlo+xhi)/2 when asked for the x attribute.

#939 - Docs: note XSPEC convolution models are new in 4.12.2
    Documentation only change noting  that the support for XSPEC convolution models 
    is new to 4.12.2.

#940 - Minor documentation improvements
    Fixed several minor issues in the existing documentation

#944 - Improve handling of the default id with PHA background datasets (fix issue #943)
    The sherpa.astro.ui.set_default_id call no-longer sets the default identifier for 
    background ids, which are now kept as the value 1. This avoids several issues when 
    using set_default_id with the background components of PHA datasets

#950 - Documentation fixes
    Minor documentation updates and adding ReSampleData to the RTD documentation

#953 - docstring fixes
    Cleans up typos in documentation

#957 - Docs: include the example notebook in the RTD pages
    Adds the example notebook (SherpaQuickStart.ipynb) to the Sphinx documentation 
    under the "Notebooks" heading

#961 - Update notebook support for Data1DInt/PHA data
    Improves the display of Data1DInt and DataPHA objects when displayed directly 
    by Jupyter notebook and add a new notebook showing off the notebook support

#963 -Docs: note plot_fit_xxx overplot change and add info on notebook support
    Adds documentation updates including notes on overplot support in plot_fit_xxx 
    and plot_bkg_fit_xxx functions and RTD notes on adding notebooks 

#964 - Docs: avoid invalid escape sequence warning
    Very-minor tweak to the Chi2 docstring

#968 - Fix 2d image filtering (fix #965)
    Fix problems with ignore2d and notice2d when multiple regions are used.

#969 - Support Python 3.8 for MacOSX
    Add a new multiprocessing_start_method option to sherpa.rc and 
    sherpa-standalone.rc and init code to set start multiprocessing method 
    to fork by default.

#971 - Docs: fix sphinx warnings
    Fix documentation in sherpa.sim.sample on the ReadTheDocs site.

#984 - Address set_xlog/ylog problems with DataPHA/Data1DInt classes (#981)
    Fix the set_xlog/ylog routines for PHA and 1D integrated datasets.


Sherpa 4.12.1
=============

This release of Sherpa supports a patch for CIAO 4.12. This release is driven by fixes that were deemed necessary to warrant a patch to sherpa in the CIAO 4.12 release. The changes include issues which had the potential of impacting users by either stopping an analysis session or providing incorrect or potentially confusing results, particularly in the area of grating analysis and multiple datasets. Additionally, this patch includes several fixes and improvements such as initial support for Python 3.8.

This version of Sherpa has been tested with Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7. There has been limited python 3.8 testing as well.

#606 - stop using numpy.typeNA which is now deprecated
    A numpy deprecation warning was fixed by removing the usage of typeNA, which
    was not documented and will be removed in a future release of numpy. The
    print_fields function has been changed to include a default mapping using
    the current typeNA implementation.

#608 - update ciao default plotter to matplotlib
    The default Sherpa plotting package has been changed to matplotlib for 
    CIAO users as well (it had been the default for standalone users for
    several years). The update will be applied to new users when the 
    `sherpa` command is run. Users of previous versions would need to 
    edit/regenerate the file.

#616 - enable run-time-option to test cache (default=True)
    Capability to allow the user to turn off caching at runtime for testing 
    purpose.

#622 - Do not create warnings about error bars in plots if no error bars are to be shown (fix #621)
    Remove the The displayed errorbars have been supplied with the data or 
    calculated using chi2xspecvar... warnings that appear for data, 
    residual/ratio, and fit plots when the user has explicitly turned off 
    the display of errorbars (by setting the yerrorbars plot-preference 
    setting to False).

#626 - add plot_fit_ratio and plot_bkg_fit_ratio functions
    Add the plot_fit_ratio function to the sherpa.ui layer (to match 
    plot_fit_resid and plot_fit_delchi) and plot_bkg_fit_ratio to the
    sherpa.astro.ui layer. Added tests for a number of plot types.

#640 - fix 'tuple index out of range' error in the fit.est_errors method
    Sherpa's Confidence class is confused if a parameter is frozen then 
    thawed after a fit resulting with an exception of the form: IndexError:
    tuple index out of range. The error does not show up if conf is called
    from the ui level

#647 - fix numpy hist warnings
    When plotting a PDF Sherpa now calls numpy.histogram with density=True |
    False rather than normed=True|False. There is no change visible to the
    user other than a warning that will not be issued anymore. normed=True 
    was broken for non uniform bins, but our code always produces uniform
    bins, so we should never hit the problematic case.

#658 - Handle files with MJD_OBS or MJD-OBS keywords (datastack module)
    The sherpa.astro.datastack module has been updated to deal with files 
    that use the MJD-OBS keyword instead of MJD_OBS. This is only used by 
    the show_stack routine, which prints out several keywords from each 
    file in the stack.

#665 - Remove python 2.7 support (fix #498)
    Remove support for Python 2.7 from Sherpa. The metadata used by pip now
    requires python 3.5 or higher (but not version 4),

#667 - improve matplotlib plot_fit plots (order of data and model)
    Changes to Zorder of plot objects drawn by matplotlib to be more readable

#674 - Add link/unlink parameter tests
    This PR adds three tests for sherpa's un/link commands.

#677 - XSPEC: build against 12.10.1m by removing support for models
    Remove support for XSrelline, XSrelline_lp, and XSrelline_lp_ext models.
    These were added in 12.10.1 but removed in 12.10.1m. It does not seem
    worth supporting just those versions where they were available.

#680 - Remove the unused parameter in sherpa.astro.optical.LogEmission model (fix #219)
    Remove the unused parameter in the sherpa.astro.optical.LogEmission 
    model. The LogEmission model only has four parameters (fwhm, pos, flux
    and skew) consistent within the calc method. The hidden parameter limit
    and it doc were removed.

#682 - jointplot now respects the ratio argument (top plot is larger) with matplotlib backend
    The matplotlib back end now makes the main (top) plot taller than the 
    secondary (bottom) plot when using the sherpa.ui.plot_fit_resid and 
    sherpa.ui.plot_fit_delchi routines (this also holds for the 
    sherpa.astro.ui variants).

#683 - Remove chips from the documentation
    Remove mention of ChIPS from the documentation (both on read the docs 
    and in the sherpa.astro.ui and sherpa.ui modules), replacing with 
    matplotlib where appropriate.

#684 - Add default config options
    Whenever an option is read from the configuration file (~/.sherpa.rc)
    provide a default option in case the configuration file is missing
    (or is missing this option).

#685 - raise ModelErr when model using Data1DInt have overlapping bins
    Adds a check to regrid make sure the integrated bins do not overlap. 
    The PR is a fix for issue #569

#688 - Improve documentation and testing for get_source_plot when sent lo/hi arguments
    Improve the documentation for the sherpa.astro.ui.get_source_plot routine,
    describing how to use the result when the lo or hi arguments are sent.

#691 - add warning when chips is selected but cannot be imported (rebase of #648)
    Sherpa now warns the user if Chips is selected as a backend but it is
    not available in the installation

#692 - Allow users to override plot preferences when creating a plot
    Change to allow kwargs to be specified to change plot preferences at 
    creation time

#698 - Add warnings in documentation about masked arrays
    Updates docstring to indicate that sherpa doesn't support numpy masked
    arrays

#701 - a fix for /data/lenin2/Test/CIAO4.11/SherpaRegressionBeta1/45   
    Enables the testers to turn on (or off) caching at runtime to test #444

#704 - change calc_ftest from delta dof to dof (similar to XSPEC) - fix for #641
    Update to make sherpa's calc_ftest provide same results as XSPEC's 
    ftest (fix to #641)

#705 - modelCacher1d needs to have a couple of deep instead of shallow copy()
    Update to make deep copy of cached function values (fix to #673)

#710 - Add warning about masked array to sherpa.astro.ui.load_arrays
    Updates docstring to contain warning consistent with #698

#712 Minor typo in docs
    Corrects a typo "is is" in the documentation.

#716 Fix for plot_cdf: plot() got an unexpected keyword argument 'clearwindpw'
    Recent changes broke plot_cdf()due to a typo 'clearwindpw'. This update
    corrects the typo.

#721 Docs: update installation notes for conda environment
    Add a warning about the need to set PYTHON_LDFLAGS to ' ' on macOS when
    building within an anaconda environment. This is a documentation-only 
    change.

#725 convert a list to np.array to avoid warning messages 
    Fixes issue #723 (a lot of warnings while running 'resample_data()' in 
    CIAO4.12 Sherpa)

#728 a fix cause using load_multi_arfs causes caching error
    Fixes issue #717 (unable to fit if script uses load_multi_arfs/rmfs)


Sherpa 4.11.1
=============

This release of Sherpa introduces several functional improvements and bug fixes,
in particular Sherpa now has support for:
  * asymmetric error bars
  * PSFs with better pixel resolution than the data
  * running optimization in parallel

Details
-------

#630 Fix "get_int_proj does not work when recalc=True" (#543)
    get_int_proj did not work when recalc=True on Python 3. This has now been fixed.

#615 Asymmetric Errors
    Sherpa now supports asymmetric error bars. Errors can be read through a new
`load_ascii_with_errors` high level function, or through the new
`Data1DAsymmetricErrs` class. Sherpa uses bootstrap for estimating the uncertainties.

#585 plot pvalue
    Updates to utilize the appropriate response files (ARF and RMF) for X-ray spectra
    and changes to the p_value output to 1/(number of simulations) when p_value is 0
    and the number of simulations in not large enough.

#596 Run optimization algorithms over multiple cores
    This PR enables the user to run the optimization algorithms (DifEvo, LevMar,
and NelderMead) on multi-cores.

#607 PSF rebinning (fix #43)
    Sherpa now supports using a PSF with a finer resolution than 2D images. If Sherpa
detects that the PSF has a smaller pixel size than the data, it will evaluate the
model on a "PSF Space" that has the same resolution as the PSF and the same footprint as
the data, then rebin the evaluated model back to the data space for calculating the statistic.

#614 Refactor data classes (fix #563, #627, #628)
    Sherpa's basic data classes have been refactored and cleaned up to help
facilitating fixing bugs and implementing new features. New tests were added to reduce
the chances of introducing regressions in the future.

#612 Fix #609 User Model: unable to change parameter values
    A regression introduced in Sherpa 4.10.0 presented users from change
user-model parameter values through direct access. This issue has been
fixed. Several tests were added to reduce the chance of regressions in
the future.

Fix #514 - the command line tool `sherpa_smoke` in the conda package now correctly honors
command line arguments.


Sherpa 4.11.0
=============

This release of Sherpa is based on the CIAO 4.11 release and includes
additional bug fixes and improvements.

Optimization routines and statistic methods were made more robust with several
bug fixes and improvements.

This version of Sherpa has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.
Support for Python 2.7 is being deprecated and may be dropped in future
releases.

This release also provides support for XSPEC 12.10.1 (patch 'a' or later) in
addition to versions 12.10.0 (included in CIAO) and version 12.9.1.

Details
-------

Documentation and infrastructure fixes are not shown.

#444 Improve caching
    When fitting multiple datasets simultaneously Sherpa now tries to cache
model evaluations to improve performance.

#465 Support XSPEC 12.10.0 (fix #436)
    XSPEC 12.10.0e is now supported

#508 Ensure fields are initialized before use (pileup code)
    Resolved an issue where some fields in the C++ extension could have been
uninitialized in a corner case.

#523 Ensure the ui modules have a unique list of exported symbols (fix #502)
    Remove the `sherpa.utils.erf` symbol from the two `ui` modules as it is
"over-written" by the ModelWrapper-created symbol when applied to
`sherpa.models.basic.Erf`.

#524 Be explicit about 'invalid escape characters' in strings
    Convert strings that contain "invalid" escape characters, which newer
versions of Python complain about, to raw strings by preceding them with a 'r'
character.

#525 Fixed based line radpro_dm test and changed double --> real (template)

#530 Ensure XSPEC 12.10.0 uses ATOMDB 3.0.9 by default
    Ensure that the default AtomDB version is 3.0.9 when using XSPEC 12.10.0.
This is to fix an issue with the models-only XSPEC installation in XSPEC
12.10.0 which uses a default version of 3.0.7 but only provides data files for
3.0.9. Without this change models such as XSapec would return all 0's (unless
the AtomDB version was set manually by the user).

#534 XSPEC 12.10.1 support and mtable fix
    Sherpa now supports XSPEC 12.10.1. Several issues were fixed to ensure
compatibility with this release. Note that there are known issues with version
12.10.1 (no patches), so at least v12.10.1a must be used.

#537 / #552 sherpa.rc changes
    Sherpa does not read the verbosity.level setting from sherpa.rc anymore but
the option is still in the file for backward compatibility

#539 Fix XSPEC models: mtable table models and ismabs (fix #535, #538, #540)
    Fix to address issues with XSpec- #535 XSPEC multiplicative table models
(mtable models loaded with load_xstable_model); #538 incorrect evaluation of
the ismabs model; #540 the kerrd model evaluated to 0 for XSPEC 12.10.0 and
later.

#546 Small code cleanup in LevMar
    small code cleanup in the LevMar class to match the other classes in that
file.

#564 / #567 Harmonise the handling of dof is zero or negative in fit and calc_stat_info (fix #565)
    The `fit` and `calc_stat_info` methods now use the same code to calculate
the reduced statistic (`rstat`) and "quality of fit" (`qval`) values. This
avoids a `TypeError` when the number of degrees of freedom is negative in
`calc_stat_info` and ensures that `NaN` is returned for both values when the
goodness-of-fit calculation has failed (e.g. the reduced statistic is zero or
less or the statistic is negative), whereas in previous versions the `qval`
value could be `None` or `1` depending on the code path.

#576 Fix regression with responses `get_x` method
    Version 4.10.1 introduced a regression which made the `get_x()` method fail
when called on RMF and ARF objects. This has been resolved.

#583 Update pager code (fix #445 #561)
    Replace the use of an external pager (such as `more` or `less`) with a
Python one. This means that Sherpa no-longer uses the PAGER environment
variable, and that the screen output from the `show_*` series of commands
should now appear in the correct location when using a Jupyter notebook or the
spyder application.


Sherpa 4.10.2
==========

This release fixes a regression introduced in Sherpa 4.10.1 related to PSF convolution. As part of the long term PSF rebinning improvements,
Sherpa 4.10.1 introduced a check to validate that the data pixel size and the PSF pixel size match. If they don't match, then a warning is issued.
The change did not account for an edge error case. Sherpa 4.10.2 solves this problem.
The regression introduced a downstream regression in the gammapy project.

Details
---------

#551 Fix gammapy/gammapy#1905, catch errors with psf pixel size.
Sherpa did not properly catch errors when checking the PSF pixel size matches the image pixel size. This has now been fixed.

Caveats
-----------
There is a potential issue for macOS conda users with python > 3.6 and matplotlib v3.0.1, when pyqt5 is not installed and selected as a matplotlib
backend. With this specific combination of platform and dependencies matplotlib can fail to work properly. The issue can be replicated without
importing Sherpa, so this is not a Sherpa bug.

Several workarounds exist, the simplest of which are:
    * install pyqt5 (`conda install pyqt`).
    * downgrade matplotlib to v2 or v3.0.0 (`conda install matplotlib=3.0.0`)

Sherpa 4.10.1
=============

This release fixes several bugs and introduces a few new features, notably the ability to evaluate model components on
arbitrary grids and generate user-defined ARFs and RMFs. Also, as of this release Sherpa will no longer rely on any
Fortran code. See the following section for details.

It is now possible to build the Sherpa documentation using Sphinx. Additionally, the Sphinx documentation is
automatically built and hosted on ReadTheDocs: https://sherpa.readthedocs.io/

Details
-------

#407 Ensure 0-length array is an error in filter_resp (fix #405)
    Add an explicit check in the C++ filter_resp code to error out if the noticed channels array
    is empty.

#422 Improve error message with wrong xspec version
    Improve the handling of XSPEC versions mismatch.

#466 Fix bounding box out-of-bounds memory read
    Avoid an out-of-bounds memory read when calling pad_bounding_box (when the data is not
    matching the expected conditions for this call).

#469 Evaluate model on finer grid
    Sherpa users can now define arbitrary grids, called evaluation spaces, on which to
    evaluate individual model components, both in 1D and 2D. This can be useful in a number
    of cases, for instance when it is desirable to evaluate models on a finer grid than the one
    defined by the data, or in convolution models where information outside of the data range
    can be used to reduce boundary effects or to inform the evaluation inside the data space.
    Also, when plotting individual 1D model components (plot_source_component), if a specific
    evaluation space was attached to the model then the plot will be of the model evaluated
    over that evaluation space, not the data space. Other plotting commands should be
    unaffected by this change.

#470 Order for np.ones() should be a one length string not a bool
    Fixed a `DeprecationWarning` in the optimization module.

#471 Using overwrite rather than clobber of astropy.io.fits
    `clobber` in astropy has been deprecated for a while now in favour of overwrite and thus
    issues a `DeprecationWarning`. Sherpa now uses `overwrite` instead.

#475 Fix unnecessary runtime warning (fix #402)
    A condition check in the optimization code was modified so as not to produce a warning
    when the value is a NaN.

#481 Remove Fortran code
    Sherpa does not rely on any Fortran routines anymore, except those compiled in XSPEC.
    The existing Fortran code, which was used mainly in some of the optimization routines, has
    been replaced by equivalent C++ code. This means that gfortran is no longer required for
    building Sherpa, although a version of libgfortran compatible with the one used to link the
    XSPEC libraries would still be needed at runtime if the XSPEC extension is
    built.

#482 ARF/RMF creation functions
    The `create_rmf` and `create_arf` functions now allow users to easily generate user
    defined response objects.

#486 `ZeroDivisionError` in `calc_stat_info` (fix #476)
    Sherpa did not catch divisions by zero in the calc_stat_info command. That has been fixed.

#484 Equivalent Width errors
    Several optional arguments `(params=None, error=False, otherids=(), niter=1000)`, were
    added to `eqwidth`. If `error = True`, then get_draws shall be run if the fit stat is one of the
    following: (Cash,  CStat, WStat) otherwise a multivariate normal distribution shall be run to
    generate the samples. The optional niter parameter is used to generate the number of
    samples. The optional parameter otherids is only used if get_draws is used internally when
    multiple data sets were used to fit. Alternatively, the user can enter the samples via the
    `params` option where the samples must be a `numpy.ndarray` of dimension `(num, npar)`.

#487 PSF bin size warning
    Sherpa assumes that the PSF image and the data have the same pixel size. When this is
    not true Sherpa ignores the difference, which results in a larger PSF being applied. From
    now on Sherpa will issue a warning when the PSF image
    pixel size and the data image pixel size are different.

Sherpa 4.10.0
=============
This release of Standalone Sherpa corresponds to the Sherpa code released as part of CIAO 4.10.

Sherpa 4.10.0 fixes several bugs related to the support of instrumental responses, including improved support of XMM and
Swift responses.

Also, this release fixes a significant bug in the support of user statistics, improvements to the Python 3 compatibility,
more robust usage of the numpy API, as well as several other minor bug fixes and new tests.

Additionally, this release introduces support for XSPEC 12.9.1n models, as well as the ability to use aliases for
parameter names. Some parameter names have been deprecated and may be removed in a future release. We reviewed the
parameter limits for many models and updated them to reflect the latest XSPEC specification. Also, multiple versions of
XSPEC are now supported, through optional models and version-dependent low-level function calls. This feature is for
advanced users building Sherpa from source. Note that Sherpa has been tested against XSPEC 12.9.0i, 12.9.0o, and
12.9.1n. Note that XSPEC is not directly supported by the standalone binary builds, and users are expected to build
Sherpa from sources if they want to link it against their version of XSPEC. These changes make it easier for user to
link different versions of XSPEC with the same Sherpa code base. Also note, however, that XSPEC 12.10 is not currently
supported.

Sherpa now requires pytest-3.3 or later for running the tests.

Details
---------

#438 Change from error to warning for OGIP violations
  Given that users can not easily change a response file, and previous versions of Sherpa would allow the responses to
  be used, this commit changes some of the errors recently introduced (in PR #383) into warnings. The errors for the
  first bin edge being <= 0 are still left in because users of the sherpa.astro.ui module will find that these files are
  auto-corrected for them (by PR #383).

#430 Update XSPEC parameters
  XSPEC model parameter default values, limits, and properties were reviewed and updated to reflect changes in or
  mismatches with the model.dat file shipped with XSPEC 12.9.1n.

#428 handle function name changes in XSPEC 12.9.1
  Sherpa now supports multiple versions of the XSPEC models from the 12.9.0 and 12.9.1 series. Some models recommend
  using the C-style interface over the older FORTRAN one, which may also resolve some memory access issues. For CIAO
  4.10 users this means the interfaces to XSPEC models have been updated to the 12.9.1n versions. For Standalone Sherpa
  users this means they can build and run Sherpa against a larger range of XSPEC versions, and Sherpa will pick the
  XSPEC low level model function accordingly. Note that Sherpa has been tested against XSPEC 12.9.0i, 12.9.0o, and
  12.9.1n. The 14 models that have been changed are: apec, bapec, bvapec, bvvapec, gaussian, lorentz, meka, mekal,
  raymond, vapec, vmeka, vmekal, vraymond, and vvapec.

#427 Add support for XSPEC models added in 12.9.1 (fix #331)
  Add support for models added in XSPEC 12.9.1: bvtapec, bvvtapec, tapec, vtapec, vvtapec, carbatm, hatm, ismabs,
  slimbh, snapec, TBfeo, TBgas, TBpcf, TBrel, voigt, xscat.
  Version 12.9.0 of XSPEC can still be used, in which case the models can be generated - e.g. a user can say xstapec.mdl
  to create a Python object - but it will error out when evaluated.
  The Si and S elemental parameters for the ismabs model have been renamed from the XSPEC versions since they are not
  unique using the caseinsensitive matching used by Sherpa: so SI, SII, SIII and SiI, SiII, SiIII have been renamed S_I,
  S_II, S_III and Si_I, Si_II, and Si_III respectively.
  Low level support for the following convolution models from XSPEC 12.9.1 has also been added, but there is no Python
  model support for these: clumin, rfxconv, vashift, vmshift, xilconv.

#412 support ROSAT PSPC (and similar) RMF files with AstroPy
  Add explicit tests for reading in, and using, ROSAT PSPC PHA and RMF files. Fix a bug in the AstroPy back-end handling
  of the ROSAT RMF file.

#409 EmissionGaussian model when skew parameter is not unity (fix #403)
  The `sherpa.astro.optical.EmissionGaussian` code has been fixed for the case when the skew parameter is not unity. The
  documentation has also been updated.

#399 Python 3 fixes and new tests for pha2 datasets
  Fixed several problems when using Sherpa with Python 3: failures when calling `list_bkg_ids` and `list_response_ids`
  and the parameter querying after `paramprompt(True)` has been called.
  There is also a change to avoid a `FutureWarning` being raised in the astropy backend when reading in PHA2 data files.
  Tests have been added to test the reading of a PHA2 format dataset, and new files added to the `sherpa-test-data`
  repository for this purpose.

#398 Check that list_samplers returns a list (fix #397)
  The `list_samplers` function now returns a list in Python 3 as well.

#396 Fix `set_xlog` and related commands using Python 3 (fix #393)
  Fix use of commands that set the plot state using the `sherpa.astro.ui` module, such as `set_xlog` and `set_xlinear`,
  when using Python 3.

#395 Add xspec optional models
  Sherpa has new infrastructure for supporting multiple versions of XSPEC at the same time, with models that are built
  and enabled conditionally depending on the version of XSPEC being linked. Models are assumed to have the same
  parameters and low level functions across supported versions.

#394 XSPEC build and functionality improvements
  Add support for reading and changing the path to the XSPEC "manager" directory, and reading the current XSPEC "model"
  directory (`get_xspath_manager`, `set_xspath_manager`, and `get_xspath_model`). These are intended for the power user
  and so require an explicit import from `sherpa.astro.xspec`.
  There are several improvements to the build and interface to the XSPEC model library: these have no user-visible
  changes.

#390 Add nlapec model
  The `nlapec` XSpec model has been added. Note that XSPEC 12.9.0 is now required.

#385 DS9 calls return string in Python 2 and 3 (fix #319)
  Some low lever `xpa` calls were returning byte strings rather than strings in Python 3. This had particular impact on
  the `image_getregion` function. This has now been fixed.

#383 Replace 0-energy bins in ARF and RMFs (fix #332)
  Sherpa now performs some validation of the energy ranges of ARF and RMF files against the OGIP standard. If the ranges
  are inconsistent then the code will return with an error. If one energy bound is 0 the bound is replaced with a small
  number to avoid numerical issues like division by zero. A new configuration option `minimum_energy`, if present,
  allows users to override Sherpa's default behavior.

#379 Use a line not span to draw horizontal line (fix #378)
  Ensure that the line at y=0 (residual) or y=1 (ratio) is drawn for residual or ratio plots when using matplotlib 2.0.

#373 Make sure ds9 properly works with Python 2.7 (fix #368)
 For Python versions prior to 3.2 add in explicit code to make _Popen work as a context manager.

#352 Add low-level support for the XSPEC rgsxsrc convolution model
  Add low-level support for the rgsxsrc convolution model in XSPEC. This is intended for R&D into fully supporting XSPEC
  convolution models in Sherpa.

#255 Add aliases for parameter names so to support new xspec names (fix #74)
  The XSPEC models have been updated to use parameter names that match the new XSPEC naming scheme introduced in XSPEC
  12.9.0. The old parameter names can still be used as aliases for the new name, but are deprecated and may be removed
  in a next major release. Note this allows any models to define aliases for their parameters.

Sherpa 4.9.1
============

This version introduces full support for Python 3.6. It also fixes issues with non-Chandra response files, correctly
handles the AREASCAL column in PHA files, and fixes a significant regression that was preventing user statistics from
working in v4.8.2. It also introduces a number of smaller improvements and fixes. In particular, quite a few
improvements have been made to the documentation and to the testing framework, including several new tests to improve
stability.

Details
-------

Infrastructure and minor non-functional changes have been omitted.

#335 Fix `setup.py` install command
  The `setup.py install` command was not enforcing the installation of the dependencies listed in `setup.py`. This has
  been fixed.

#368 Remove ds9 warnings when run under Python 3.6
  Update the DS9 code so that external processes are cleaned up properly, so to remove the potential ResourceWarning
  warnings when running DS9 on Python 3.6.

#351 fix handling of AREASCAL column in PHA files (fix #350)
  Add support for handling the AREASCAL value (either scalar of vector) for PHA data sets. This array is used in XMM
  RGS data to handle missing chips.

#358 Properly handle Swift RMF when using Astropy backend (fix #357)
  A Swift RMF could not be read in when the AstroPy back end was in use. The problem was that the code did not support
  RMF matrices that were not stored as variable-length arrays. This has now been fixed, and new tests have been added
  for this kind of files.

#343 Fix user statistics regression (fix #341)
  A number of regressions were introduced in version 4.8.1 up to version 4.9.0, so user statistics that were properly
  working in version 4.7 have not been working any more. This has been fixed, and a number of regression tests have
  been added.

#381 Fix `bdist_wheel` command
  We reviewed our customization of the setuptools commands as we realized that a recent bug fix (#335) introduced a
  regression in the bdist_wheel command used by pip to build Sherpa from source distributions. Both commands should now
  properly work.

Sherpa 4.9.0
============

This version fixes many bugs in the Python 3 support. Moreover, it includes a significant
refactoring of the `Fit` and `Stat` classes that made it possible to fix several bugs
related to the recent `wstat` implementation while making these classes more maintainable
and extensible.

Note that this version deprecates the use of `load_table_model` for XSPEC models.
Sherpa/XSPEC users should use the new `load_xstable_model` function instead.

Details
-------

Infrastructure and minor non-functional changes have been omitted.

#242 Avoid use of inspect.getargspec in Python3
  Finish off the replacement of inspect.getargspec by inspect.signature.

#263 List_data_ids() fails on py3 with mixed id types (Fix #262).
  Sherpa was sorting the list of dataset IDs in a non-python3 compliant fashion,
  which resulted in issues when using strings and integers together as dataset
  IDs. This has now been fixed.

#267 add wstat tests
  Add several regression tests for wstat.

#282 Parallel_map not working on py3 with numcores=1 (Fix #277).
  The `utils` function `parallel_map` failed on Python 3 when called with `numcores=1`,
  i.e. on systems with only one processor/core. This has been fixed.

#283 Sample flux and numpy deprecations (Fix #273 and #276).
  The `sample_flux` function was not working under Python 3 if the `scales` argument
  was provided. This has been fixed. Also, a `DeprecationWarning` was issued by
  `numpy` because during the `sample_flux` execution values were extracted from
  an array with non-integer indices. This has also been fixed.

#284 String representation of data classes under py3 (Fix #275).
  Data classes `DataPHA`, `DataARF`, `DataRMF`, `DataIMG`, and `DataIMGInt` in
  `sherpa.astro.data` would throw an exception if users tried to print them as
   strings, under Python 3. This has been fixed.

#287 Rewrite sherpa.stats.Stat.calc_stat and simplify sherpa.fit.Fit (fix #227 #248 #289 #292).
  In order to fix several issues related to the WStat support, and in order to
  make the code more maintainable, the `sherpa.stats.Stat.calc_stat` and
  `sherpa.fit.Fit` classes have gone through a round of refactoring. This fixes
  the following issues: #227 Issues using wstat when grouping/filtering data; #248
  backscal column not treated properly for WStat; #289 calc_stat does not error out
  if background subtracted data is used with Likelihood statistics; #292 stat info
  does not include reduced stat/qval for wstat.

#295 Fix display of pileup model in Python 3.5 (Fix #294).
  Fix display of instances of `sherpa.astro.models.JDPileup` so that, in Python 3.5,
  they can be displayed after the model has been evaluated.

#304 replace file -> open (Fix #297).
  The `save` and `restore` functions used to use the `file` function which is not
  compatible with Python 3. This has now been fixed.

#305 Fix python 3 issues with some session commands (Fix #303).
  The `set_xlog`, `set_ylog`, and `show_bkg_model` functions were not compatible
  with Python 3. This has now been fixed (Issue #303).

#307 Move XSPEC table support to load_xstable_model and deprecate its support
  in load_table_model (Fix #270).
  Add the `load_xstable_model` routine to the `sherpa.astro.ui` module, which
  supports loading XSPEC additive or multiplicative (atable and mtable) models.
  The support for these models is still available via `load_table_model` in this
  release, but it is deprecated. The `read_xstable_model` routine has been added
  to the `sherpa.astro.xspec` module.

#312 Fix over-zealous code clean up in PR #287 affecting sigmarej.
  Fits using the sigmarej iterated-fit method were broken if a filter had been
  applied to the data before the fit and there are any bins that get ignored at
  larger bin values than the filtered-out data. (This fixes a subtle regression
  introduced by #287).

#313 Allow sequence=None when using gridsearch and Python 3.5 (Fix #309).
  Allow the `gridsearch` optimiser to be used with the `sequence` option set
  to `None` for Python 3.5.

Caveats
------------

The requirements for Sherpa are to build with Python 2.7 and 3.5. There has been limited
testing with Python 3.6, for which we distribute conda binaries. If in doubt, please install
Sherpa in 2.7 or 3.5 environments only. Support for Python versions 3.3 and 3.4 is possible
but would require community support.

It has been reported during testing that some versions of the matplotlib conda package do not
install properly because of a pyqt v5 dependency. If you encounter this issue, please pin down
pyqt to version 4, e.g. `conda install matplotlib pyqt=4`.

The `sherpatest` package is not distributed as a conda package anymore. This will probably be
true for the foreseeable future. The `sherpatest` package contains data and functional tests
that relies on external datasets, so it allows users and developers to run the entire regression
tests suite. If you want to install `sherpatest`, please use pip and github:

~~~~
$ pip install https://github.com/sherpa/sherpa-test-data/archive/4.9.0.tar.gz
~~~~

If you decide to run the full regression tests suite you should also have matplotlib installed.
If matplotlib is not installed a test will run and fail rather than being skipped. This issue
will be fixed in the next release.

Sherpa 4.8.2
============

This version of Sherpa is the first one to run under both Python 2.7
and Python 3.5. The python 3 conversion is considered a beta designed
to maintain backwards compatibility with python 2.7. As such, we
expect to have some iterations before the Python 3.5 support stabilizes.

The smoke test has been greatly simplified: rather that running all of
the unit and regression tests that do not require test data, the smoke
test now simply ensures that the basic installation works, i.e. that
basic commands can be run and that dependencies can be reached. This
allows the use of more advanced tools for actual unit and regression
tests without having to ship such tools to users.

Several bugs were fixed, some enhancements implemented, and some
deprecated calls to external API replaced. In particular:

  * more documentation was migrated and is not part of the code base
    as *docstrings*.
  * the `calc_stat` API has been generalized to make statistic
    functions more extensible.
  * `calc_stat_info` now properly takes background into account when
    `wstat` is selected.

Details
-------

Infrastructure and minor non-functional changes have been omitted.

#209: Fix docstrings for `group_snr()` and `group_adapt_snr()`. Docstrings
  used to say "Combine the data so that each bin has a signal-to-noise
  ratio of at least minimum" but the end of the groups are marked only
  if the SNR exceeds the given SNR.

#210: The smoke test has been greatly simplified and it now simply ensures
  that the basic installation works, i.e. that basic commands can be run
  and that dependencies can be reached. Previously, the smoke test would
  run all unit tests. Units and regression tests can now take advantage of
  `py.test` and `mock` packages (the latter is part of the standard
  library in Python3).

#211: Cleanup of documentation and code in `sherpa.astro.utils`. The
  `calc_kcorr` function is now exported by sherpa.astro.utils. Minor
  changes to the documentation in `sherpa.astro.utils` to conform to
  Sphinx standards.

#221: Integrate existing model documentation (from external sources and
  the CIAO ahelp documentation system) into the model classes.

#229: Code is both Python 2.7 and 3.5 compliant. This included updating
  the CIAO dependencies: region, group, and stack libraries, which were
  ported to Python 3 as well.

#242: Avoid use of `inspect.argspec`, which was deprecated in Python3.

#252: `plot_photon_flux` function was calling an internal function with
  the wrong number of arguments and thus raising an error. This has been
  fixed.

#253: `calc_stat_info` call failed when `wstat` was selected, as the
  background was not taken into account. This issue has now been fixed.

#256: Fix docstring in `set_quality`, which were listing the wrong values
  of the quality flag.

#257: Fix docstring for `levmar` tolerance, which was listing the wrong
  function defaults.


Caveats/Known Issues
--------------------

The following are known issues with the standalone 4.8.2 release

  **`show_all` does not work on Python3 with PHA**. E.g., the following
    code throws an exception:

``` python
from sherpa.astro.ui.utils import Session
from sherpa.astro.data import DataPHA
session = Session()
session.load_arrays(1, [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], DataPHA)
session.show_all()
```

  **the `parallel_map` function throws an exception on Python 3** when
    only one core is available on the system running Sherpa. This impacts
    a number of functions taking advantage of tasks parallelization on
    multi-core systems. This functions include `calc_flux`, `sample_flux`,
    a number of functions for plotting parameter projections, and the
    `grid_search` optimization algorithm.

  **string representation of some (but not all) dataset classes is broken
    on Python 3**. For instance, the following code will result in an exception:

```python
from sherpa.astro.ui import *
load_pha('3c273.pi')
print(get_data())
```

  **`sample_flux` does not work on Python 3 when called with the `scales`
    argument**, e.g.:

```python
from sherpa.astro import ui

ui.load_pha('sherpa-test-data/sherpatest/3c273.pi')
ui.set_model('polynom1d.p1')
ui.fit()
ui.covar()
scal = ui.get_covar_results().parmaxes
ui.sample_flux(p1, 0.5, 1, num=5, correlated=False, scales=scal)
```



Sherpa 4.8.1
============

Sherpa 4.8.1 is the standalone counterpart to the 4.8.0 release, which was
focused on supporting CIAO 4.8. In particular, this version introduces support
for newer versions of the dependency, along with some feature enhancements,
bug fixes and additional, more accurate tests.

The newly supported dependencies:

  - matplotlib v1.5
  - numpy 1.10 (with and without mkl support)
  - xspec v12.9.0i (when building from source)
  - astropy v1.1.2
  - region library v4.8 (from CIAO 4.8)

Mode details below (infrastructure changes are not shown):

#102: fix issues when writing out FITS files using the `save_pha` and
`save_table` commands when using the `astropy`/`pyfits` backend (bug #46).
Fix for when the notice2d_id, notice2d_image, and the ignore version functions
are called with an invalid identifier (i.e. an identifier that is not an integer
or string value). The error is now an ArgumentTypeErr with the message "'ids'
must be an identifier or list of identifiers". It was a NameError with the
message "global name '_argument_type_error' is not defined".

#107: Normalize plot labels. There are two main changes for plots of PHA data
sets (and related quantities, such as the source, model, and ARF):

- plots with matplotlib now use the LaTeX support - so that 'cm^2' is
  now displayed as a superscript; previously they were displayed
  directly. This does not change the display with the ChIPS backend.

- plots created with `plot_source` used a different format to other
  plots when analysis=wavelength, in that LaTeX symbols were used for
  Angstrom and lambda (in other plots the string 'Angstrom' is used
  instead). The source plots now match the other plots.

#109: fix #103 and #113 in order to support `matplotlib` v1.5.

#116: fix bug #27. The `astropy.io.fits`/`pyfits` interface used deprecated
functionality. The code was updated to use the replacement classes/methods when
available, falling back to the original code if not. The interfaces that were
changed were, when the new symbols are available, to:

 - use `astropy.io.fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns` rather than
   `astropy.io.fits.new_table`

 - use `astropy.io.fits.Header` rather than `astropy.io.CardList`

#137: upgrade CIAO region library to v4.8

#138: improve and fix issues in `save_all` function.

 - added a new argument to `save_all`: if `outfile` is `None` then the `outfh`
   argument is used 
   to define the output handle (the argument can be any file-like argument, such
   as a file
   handle like `sys.stdout` or the output of `open`, or a `StringIO` object)
 - setting the `clobber` argument to `save_all` now means that the output file
   (the `outfile`
   argument, if not `None`) is deleted if it already exists; prior to this, the
   file would be
   appended to instead
 - the source expression is now saved correctly for most cases (e.g. when not
   using `set_full_model`); this is bug #97 but also affects non-PHA data sets
 - the background model expression was not always written out correctly when
   using PHA
   data sets
 - quality and grouping arrays of PHA data sets are now stored as 16-byte
   integers rather
   than a floating-point value (this has no affect on the results, but matches
   the OGIP standard)
 - fixed up saving the grouping and quality arrays of background PHA data sets
   (this would only
   be an issue if the background is being fit, rather than subtracted)
 - basic data sets created with the `load_arrays` function are now written out by
   `save_all`
   as part of the script; this is intended for small datasets and may have
   problems with
   precision if used with floating-point arrays
 - calls to `load_psf` are now correctly restored (they may not have been written
   out correctly
   if multiple data sets were loaded)
 - user models are now written out to disk; this consists of two parts:
 - writing out the function that defines the model, which may or may not be
   possible (if
   not, a place-holder function is added to the output and a warning
   displayed).
 - the necessary calls to `load_user_model` and `add_user_pars` are now
   included in the output
 - the Python code created by `save` all has undergone several minor changes:
 - it now explicitly imports the `sherpa.astro.ui` module, so that it can be
   run from the
   IPython prompt using the `%run <filename>` command, or directly as `python <filename>`
 - it uses the `create_model_component` function rather than `eval` to create
   model
   components (this is CXC bug 12146)
 - many optional arguments to functions are now given as `name=value` rather
   than
   being a positional argument, to make it clearer what the script is doing.
 - calls to `load_data` have been replaced by more-specific versions - e.g.
   `load_pha`
   and `load_image` - if appropriate
 - there have seen several minor syntactic clean ups to better follow the
   suggestions from PEP8 

When writing out code that defines a user-model, there is no attempt to make
sure that
modules used by the function are available. These will need to be added, either
directly
or imported, manually to the output.

#151: Ensure AstroPy and Crates behave the same with gzipped files. Change the
behaviour of the AstroPy back end so that it matches that of Crates when given a
file name which does not exist, but a compressed version, with the suffix `.gz`
does. The Crates behavior is to read the file. This extends to PHA files whose
ancillary files - e.g. those stored in the `BACKFILE`, `ANCRFILE`, and
`RESPFILE` keywords - are given as unzipped names, but only the gzipped names
exist on disk.

As an example: if `pha.fits.gz` exists but `pha.fits` does not, then

    load_pha('pha.fits')

will now load the file with either back end. If the response files are set to
`arf.fits` and `rmf.fits` (via the `ANCRFILE` and `RESPFILE` keywords), but only
the `.gz` versions exist, then they will now also be loaded by the AstroPy back
end.

#153: Make comparison test in `calc_chi2datavar_errors` less stringent, so to
include the case where `sqrt(x)=0`.

#155: The `get_draws` function now accepts a user-provided covariance matrix. If
no covariance matrix is provided, the covariance matrix computed by the default
implementation is used. Note that `covar()` must be invoked before invoking
`get_draws` if no covariance matrix is provided, otherwise `get_draws` will exit
with an error.

#158: Fix bug that prevented region ascii files to be read in standalone
Sherpa.

#165: Remove usage of deprecated numpy API.

#185: Fix the problem where if the working directory contained a file called
`x` or `y` then the `sherpa.astro.ui.image_data()` function would fail with the message

     DS9Err: Could not display image

#187: Fix #92: a more meaningful message is given to the user when
`sherpa.astro.io` is imported directly and no fits backends are available.

#188: Fix #93. The `sherpa_test` script now tries to install the test
dependencies before running the tests (but not the `sherpatest` package, which
should be installed by the user if necessary, due to its footprint). If this is
not possible, and the necessary dependencies (`pytest`) are not found, then a
meaningful message is given to the user with instructions on how to install the
dependencies. Also, the dependency on `pytest-cov` has been removed. Users can
enable coverage reports from the command line if necessary.

#190: Fix #22 - The datastack package can now be used even if there is no
available plotting backend. In this case, plotting functions will not be
available, but the rest of the datastack functionality will. 


Sherpa 4.8.0
============

This version of Sherpa  introduces 'wstat' statistics which is an extension
of 'cstat' with Poisson background data. It also provides the ability to include
background data with the 'user statistics'.

Many changes were aimed at improving the Xspec extension by making it more
robust, intuitive, and by fixing several bugs. Sherpa 4.8.0 supports Xspec 12.9.0d
and was also tested against versions 12.8.2e, 12.8.2l, and 12.8.2q.

Most of the codebase was reviewed and cleaned up, in particular to remove the
use of deprecated functionality and to comply with Python's PEP8 standard.
More tests were added to the test suite, and
a new testing infrastructure was put in place in order to simplify writing and
running tests, and to measure the test suite code coverage.

More details below (infrastructure changes are not shown):

#32: Fix segfault from CRATES update in 4.8b1. Since v4.8b1 CRATES returns
variable length arrays by default, rather than the zero-padded fixed length
ones it used to return. Sherpa manipulated the arrays so to remove the
zero-padding and obtaining variable length arrays. The change in the CRATES
API resulted in Sherpa segfaulting when trying to manipulate the data coming
from CRATES. In the patch, we use a new API offered by CRATES to get the
old-style fixed-length arrays instead of the new default ones. In the future,
we may want to update the Sherpa code to deal with the new arrays directly.

#44: `save_quality` now correctly outputs 'QUALITY' as the column name,
instead of 'GROUPS'.

#48: Fix up several issues seen in plot labels - titles and Y-axis labels -
for commands such as `sherpa.ui.plot_data`, `sherpa.ui.plot_fit_resid`, and
`sherpa.ui.plot_chisqr`.

#59: Fix bug #38 (grouping twice gives an IndexError exception). An un-handled
corner case in one of the Sherpa internal methods (`utils.create_expr`) was
triggering an `IndexError` when two `group_counts` operations were performed
back to back. The fix handles the case so that applying `group_counts` twice
does not result in an Exception.

#77: Replace `==` and `!=` comparisons to `None` with `is` and `is not`.

#78: OutOfBoundErr exceptions in some sherpa.utils
functions are properly caught. There were several places where screen output
used either `print` or `sys.stderr.write`.

#81: Ensure that XSPEC models which fail - for instance, because a data file
it needs is missing - return 0's for all bins, rather than random values. This
should make it more obvious that something has gone wrong (for instance if the
XSPEC chatter level is low enough not to show any error messages, as is the
case for the default setting used by Sherpa, namely 0).

#82: The XSpec "spectrum number" value is now set to 1 rather than 0, as this
value is 1-based in Xspec.

#83: Removed S-Lang scripts, files, and references in the code.

#84: Clarified error messages in Xspec extension. Also, changed the class of
the exception from `RuntimeError` to more appropriate exception types, in
particular `LookupError`, `ValueError`, `KeyError`. This is a
backwards-incompatible change, in that code that caught the `RuntimeError`
will not catch the new error.

#87: Some methods in `sherpa/fit.py` assigned mutable objects to default
arguments. This has now been fixed. More instances of this issue have been
identified (Bug #95) and will removed in the future.

#90: Added background data to the UserStat class.

#94: Implement wstat statistic as described at the following url:
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/XSappendixStatistics.html

#96: Remove the unused myoptfct module.

#99: Correct the documentation for the `set_exposure` function.

#100 Fix bug #97, whereby the save_all function would not create the necessary
`set_source()` line. This does not fix all cases, but it does the simple PHA
case such as

~~~~
load_pha('src.pi')
set_source(xsphabs.gal * powlaw1d.pl)
save_all('test.out).
~~~~

It also ensures that files created by `save_all`
can be run using IPython's %run directive, by explicitly importing the
`sherpa.astro.ui` module.

#101: Fix handling of non-contiguous bins in Xspec - i.e. when a model is
called with both xlo and xhi arguments but the bins do not fully cover the
energy, or wavelenth, range. This fixes #62 (for XSPEC 12.8.2; switching to
XSPEC 12.9.0 should also fix it) and #56. It also fixes an (un-reported)
problem with handling of non-contiguous grids when using a table model, where
a crash was likely.  When an XSPEC model is called with both low and high
values for the grid - i.e. with two arguments - then the two arrays are
checked to have the same length, and a ValueError is raised if this condition
does not hold. This is a breaking change, but the results are not guaranteed
to be correct if the two arrays are not the same length.  The experimental
interface for XSPEC convolution models has changed, so that the function call
takes pars, fluxes, xlo, with optional xhi whereas before it was pars, xlo,
xhi, fluxes. This is a breaking change, but this is in the low-level API that
is not documented to users, and adds useful functionality (the ability to have
xhi be optional). The cpflux convolution model has been added. Note that these
models do not have Python classes associated with them as they are still an
experimental interface.  The test suite has been updated to test the new and
changed functionality in this PR. The choice of models is made so as to avoid
known problematic models (with a version check where relevant).  It is
believed that the changes in this PR fixes #42, although this is hard to prove
conclusively given the erratic nature of the bug.

#110: Update the sherpa.astro.datastack module documentation to include information from the
CIAO ahelp documentation and to match the style used by the sherpa.astro.ui module.

#111: Update the documentation to include more information about the pyBLoCXS code.
