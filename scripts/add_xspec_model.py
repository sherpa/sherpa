"""Usage:

  ./add_xspec_model.py infile model

Aim:

Given an XSPEC model.dat file report and an XSPEC model name
(e.g. without the xs prefix), output the necessary code to create the
Python and C++ wrapper interface. You still need to add the code to
the necessary files and update them to add documentation and deal with
any possible version updates.
