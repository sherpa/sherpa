The sherpa module contains an experimental citation() function which
will return the citation information for the latest release or a given
release:

   >>> import sherpa
   >>> sherpa.citation()
   >>> sherpa.citation('4.16.1')

The output can be saved to a file by setting the filename argument.

This will only work if you have internet access (at least for the
latest query) as it takes the data from the Sherpa record at
Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/3944985

The Zenodo guide to versioning at http://help.zenodo.org/#versioning
provides advice on how to cite the correct version.

If you want a general-purpose citation then please use either of the
following, kindly provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System
service:
