                      Argonne National Laboratory

         Burton S. Garbow, Kenneth E. Hillstrom, Jorge J. More

                               March 1980


 1. Purpose.

       The purpose of LMDIF is to minimize the sum of the squares of M
       nonlinear functions in N variables by a modification of the
       Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.  The user must provide a subrou-
       tine which calculates the functions.  The Jacobian is then cal-
       culated by a forward-difference approximation.


 2. Subroutine and type statements.

       SUBROUTINE LMDIF(FCN,M,N,X,FVEC,FTOL,XTOL,GTOL,MAXFEV,EPSFCN,
      *                 DIAG,MODE,FACTOR,NPRINT,INFO,NFEV,FJAC,LDFJAC,
      *                 IPVT,QTF,WA1,WA2,WA3,WA4)
       INTEGER M,N,MAXFEV,MODE,NPRINT,INFO,NFEV,LDFJAC
       INTEGER IPVT(N)
       DOUBLE PRECISION FTOL,XTOL,GTOL,EPSFCN,FACTOR
       DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(M),DIAG(N),FJAC(LDFJAC,N),QTF(N),
      *                 WA1(N),WA2(N),WA3(N),WA4(M)
       EXTERNAL FCN


 3. Parameters.

       Parameters designated as input parameters must be specified on
       entry to LMDIF and are not changed on exit, while parameters
       designated as output parameters need not be specified on entry
       and are set to appropriate values on exit from LMDIF.

       FCN is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which calculates
         the functions.  FCN must be declared in an EXTERNAL statement
         in the user calling program, and should be written as follows.

         SUBROUTINE FCN(M,N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
         INTEGER M,N,IFLAG
         DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(M)
         ----------
         CALCULATE THE FUNCTIONS AT X AND
         RETURN THIS VECTOR IN FVEC.
         ----------
         RETURN
         END


                                                                 Page 2

         The value of IFLAG should not be changed by FCN unless the
         user wants to terminate execution of LMDIF.  In this case set
         IFLAG to a negative integer.

       M is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
         functions.

       N is a positive integer input variable set to the number of
         variables.  N must not exceed M.

       X is an array of length N.  On input X must contain an initial
         estimate of the solution vector.  On output X contains the
         final estimate of the solution vector.

       FVEC is an output array of length M which contains the functions
         evaluated at the output X.

       FTOL is a nonnegative input variable.  Termination occurs when
         both the actual and predicted relative reductions in the sum
         of squares are at most FTOL.  Therefore, FTOL measures the
         relative error desired in the sum of squares.  Section 4 con-
         tains more details about FTOL.

       XTOL is a nonnegative input variable.  Termination occurs when
         the relative error between two consecutive iterates is at most
         XTOL.  Therefore, XTOL measures the relative error desired in
         the approximate solution.  Section 4 contains more details
         about XTOL.

       GTOL is a nonnegative input variable.  Termination occurs when
         the cosine of the angle between FVEC and any column of the
         Jacobian is at most GTOL in absolute value.  Therefore, GTOL
         measures the orthogonality desired between the function vector
         and the columns of the Jacobian.  Section 4 contains more
         details about GTOL.

       MAXFEV is a positive integer input variable.  Termination occurs
         when the number of calls to FCN is at least MAXFEV by the end
         of an iteration.

       EPSFCN is an input variable used in determining a suitable step
         for the forward-difference approximation.  This approximation
         assumes that the relative errors in the functions are of the
         order of EPSFCN.  If EPSFCN is less than the machine preci-
         sion, it is assumed that the relative errors in the functions
         are of the order of the machine precision.

       DIAG is an array of length N.  If MODE = 1 (see below), DIAG is
         internally set.  If MODE = 2, DIAG must contain positive
         entries that serve as multiplicative scale factors for the
         variables.

       MODE is an integer input variable.  If MODE = 1, the variables
         will be scaled internally.  If MODE = 2, the scaling is


                                                                 Page 3

         specified by the input DIAG.  Other values of MODE are equiva-
         lent to MODE = 1.

       FACTOR is a positive input variable used in determining the ini-
         tial step bound.  This bound is set to the product of FACTOR
         and the Euclidean norm of DIAG*X if nonzero, or else to FACTOR
         itself.  In most cases FACTOR should lie in the interval
         (.1,100.).  100. is a generally recommended value.

       NPRINT is an integer input variable that enables controlled
         printing of iterates if it is positive.  In this case, FCN is
         called with IFLAG = 0 at the beginning of the first iteration
         and every NPRINT iterations thereafter and immediately prior
         to return, with X and FVEC available for printing.  If NPRINT
         is not positive, no special calls of FCN with IFLAG = 0 are
         made.

       INFO is an integer output variable.  If the user has terminated
         execution, INFO is set to the (negative) value of IFLAG.  See
         description of FCN.  Otherwise, INFO is set as follows.

         INFO = 0  Improper input parameters.

         INFO = 1  Both actual and predicted relative reductions in the
                   sum of squares are at most FTOL.

         INFO = 2  Relative error between two consecutive iterates is
                   at most XTOL.

         INFO = 3  Conditions for INFO = 1 and INFO = 2 both hold.

         INFO = 4  The cosine of the angle between FVEC and any column
                   of the Jacobian is at most GTOL in absolute value.

         INFO = 5  Number of calls to FCN has reached or exceeded
                   MAXFEV.

         INFO = 6  FTOL is too small.  No further reduction in the sum
                   of squares is possible.

         INFO = 7  XTOL is too small.  No further improvement in the
                   approximate solution X is possible.

         INFO = 8  GTOL is too small.  FVEC is orthogonal to the
                   columns of the Jacobian to machine precision.

         Sections 4 and 5 contain more details about INFO.

       NFEV is an integer output variable set to the number of calls to
         FCN.

       FJAC is an output M by N array.  The upper N by N submatrix of
         FJAC contains an upper triangular matrix R with diagonal ele-
         ments of nonincreasing magnitude such that


                                                                 Page 4

    The Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm, devised by J.A. Nelder and

    finding local minimum of an objective function of several
    variables. The implementation of Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm is
    a variation of the algorithm outlined in [2]_ and [3]_. As noted,
    terminating the simplex is not a simple task:

    "For any non-derivative method, the issue of termination is
    problematical as well as highly sensitive to problem scaling.
    Since gradient information is unavailable, it is provably
    impossible to verify closeness to optimality simply by sampling f

    the progress of the algorithm: either the function values at the

       the quadratic surface fit is not done.  If the fit to the
       quadratic surface is not positive semi-definitive, then the
       search terminated prematurely.  The code to fit the quadratic
       surface was written by D. E. Shaw, CSIRO, Division of
       Mathematics & Statistics, with amendments by
       R. W. M. Wedderburn, Rothamsted Experimental Station, and Alan
       Miller, CSIRO, Division of Mathematics & Statistics.  See also

    verbose: int
       The amount of information to print during the fit. The default
       is `0`, which means no output.

    Notes
    -----

    The `initsimplex` option determines how the non-degenerate initial
    simplex is to be constructed:

    - when `initsimplex` is `0`:

      Then x_(user_supplied) is one of the vertices of the simplex.
      The other `n` vertices are::

        for ( int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i ) {
          for ( int j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j )
            x[ i + 1 ][ j ] = x_[ j ];
            x[ i + 1 ][ i ] = x_[ i ] + step[ i ];
        }

      where step[i] is the ith element of the option step.

    - if `initsimplex` is `1`:

      Then x_(user_supplied) is one of the vertices of the simplex.
      The other `n` vertices are::

                    { x_[j] + pn,   if i - 1 != j
                    {
        x[i][j]  =  {
                    {
                    { x_[j] + qn,   otherwise

      for 1 <= i <= n, 0 <= j < n and::

        pn = ( sqrt( n + 1 ) - 1 + n ) / ( n * sqrt(2) )
        qn = ( sqrt( n + 1 ) - 1 ) / ( n * sqrt(2) )

    The `finalsimplex` option determines whether the simplex has
    converged:

    - case a (if the max length of the simplex is small enough)::

        max( | x_i - x_0 | ) <= ftol max( 1, | x_0 | )
        1 <= i <= n

    - case b (if the standard deviation the simplex is < `ftol`)::

         n           -   2
        ===   ( f  - f )
        \        i                    2
        /     -----------     &lt;=  ftol
        ====   sqrt( n )
        i = 0

    - case c (if the function values are close enough)::

        f_0  < f_(n-1)     within ftol

    The combination of the above stopping criteria are:

    - case 0: same as case a

    - case 1: case a, case b and case c have to be met

    - case 2: case a and either case b or case c have to be met.

    The `finalsimplex` value controls which of these criteria need to
    hold:

    - if `finalsimplex=0` then convergence is assumed if case 1 is met.

    - if `finalsimplex=1` then convergence is assumed if case 2 is met.

    - if `finalsimplex=2` then convergence is assumed if case 0 is met
      at two consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=3` then convergence is assumed if case 0 then
      case 1 are met on two consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=4` then convergence is assumed if case 0 then
      case 1 then case 0 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=5` then convergence is assumed if case 0 then
      case 1 then case 0 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=6` then convergence is assumed if case 1 then
      case 1 then case 0 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=7` then convergence is assumed if case 2 then
      case 1 then case 0 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=8` then convergence is assumed if case 0 then
      case 2 then case 0 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=9` then convergence is assumed if case 0 then
      case 1 then case 1 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=10` then convergence is assumed if case 0 then
      case 2 then case 1 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=11` then convergence is assumed if case 1 is
      met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=12` then convergence is assumed if case 1 then
      case 2 then case 1 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - if `finalsimplex=13` then convergence is assumed if case 2 then
      case 1 then case 1 are met on three consecutive iterations.

    - otherwise convergence is assumed if case 2 is met on three
      consecutive iterations.
