# Note that the logic in load_table_model is quite convoluted,
# since it has a lot of fall-through cases, so these checks are
# used in case of any refactoring. Since load_table_model and
# load_xstable_model are similar in these regards the tests are
# used for both.
#
# The tests are manually repeated, rather than sending in the
# load function as a parameter, as I was unable to get the latter
# to work well.
