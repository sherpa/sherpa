# NumPy arrays have a threshold size print option, such that when an
# array greater than that size is converted to a string, for printing,
# only the first few and last few elements are shown.  If the array is
# smaller than the threshold size, all the elements are printed out.
# (This setting makes no change to the actual array, but merely
# governs how the array is represented when a copy of the array is
# converted to a string.)
#
# The default threshold size is 1000.  Here, the threshold size is
# changed to a much larger value as Sherpa often deals with large
# arrays.

[multiprocessing]
# Define the method by which the multiprocessing package starts
# parallel processes. Sherpa requires the "fork" method in order to
# utilize multiprocessing to improve performance and pass all tests.
# However, on MacOSX there are known issues with using "fork" that
# prompted a change in the multiprocessing default to be "spawn" on
# MacOSX. Expert users may consider changing this value to either
# "spawn" or "default", where the latter will use the
# platform-specific start method of the multiprocessing package.
