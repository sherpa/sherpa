  are converted to FITS headers for use by other programs and can be
  derived from FITS headers for writing.
imio.c
  Subroutines to get, put, and move pixels of various data types between images
  im memory and a program.
imrotate.c
  RotFITS() rotates an image by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, with an optional
  left-right reflection before the rotation.
imgetwcs.c
  GetWCSFITS() reads world coordinate system header information and returns
  the image center coordinates and size as well as the wcs data structure.
imsetwcs.c
  SetWCSFITS() uses findStars to find the stars in an image, gscread to
  find the Guide Stars in the nominal image region, and findRegisration or
  findCoords to fit plate-tangent WCS to the image.
lin.c
  WCSLIB linear transformation subroutines
matchstar.c
  StarMatch() takes a list of reference star positions and a list
  of object coordinates from an image and finds the image pixels
  which correspond to each of the reference stars.  It then uses these
  matches to get an image center, plate scale, and rotation.  The actual
  fit is based on the amoeba subroutine in Numerical Recipes, and all
  necessary subroutines are included.
platepos.c
  platepos() uses the WCS structure to compute sky coordinates given
  image pixel X and Y for images with polynomial plate solutions
  in their headers.  platepix() uses the WCS structure to compute image
  pixel X and Y given sky coordinates for such images.  Algorithms are based
  on those in dsspos.c, but go straight from pixels to angles without an
  intermediate plate coordinate.
poly.c
  Polynomial evaluation for SCAMP distortion correction
proj.c
  WCSLIB spherical map projection subroutines
sdssread.c
  Return Sloan Digital Sky Survey Photometry Catalog sources using an
  HTTP query over the web for a given RA, Dec, and magnitude range.
sortstars.c
  Subroutines to sort lists of stars by right ascension, magnitude, or flux
sph.c
  WCSLIB spherical coordinate transformation subroutines
tabread.c
  Return stars from a tab table format catalog file for a given RA, Dec,
  and magnitude range or list of star numbers.  Based on John Roll's
  Starbase format.
tmcread.c
  Return 2MASS Point Source Catalog stars from the catalog as ungzipped from
  the DVD into (or linked from) a common root directory for a given RA, Dec,
  and magnitude range or list of star numbers.  Both IDR2 and All-Sky release
  formats are supported.
tnxpos.c
  tnxpos() uses the WCS keywords set up for IRAF's TNX projection to compute
  sky coordinates given image pixel X and Y.  tnxpix() uses the WCS structure
  to compute image pixel X and Y given sky coordinates for such images.  The
  projection is a tangent plane with corrections between the rotation and
  scaling and the actual projection.

  files for a given RA, Dec, and magnitude range or list of star numbers.

  a given RA, Dec, and magnitude range or list of star numbers.

  system information.

  Open Starbase files across the Internet using HTTP queries
worldpos.c
  worldpos() uses the WCS structure to compute sky coordinates given
  image pixel X and Y for images with header information for any of 8
  standard world coordinate systems.  worldpix() uses the WCS structure
  to compute image pixel X and Y given sky coordinates for the same images.
  Mostly from NRAO.
zpxpos.c
  zpxpos() uses the WCS keywords set up for IRAF's ZPX projection to
  compute sky coordinates given image pixel X and Y.  zpxpix() uses
  the WCS structure to compute image pixel X and Y given sky coordinates
  for such images.  The projection is a tangent plane with corrections
  between the rotation and scaling and the actual projection.

lwcs.h

  Declaration of WCS data structure and useful conversions.
wcslib.h
  Declarations for WCSLIB high level driver subroutines, trig and inverse
  trig functions, spherical map projection subroutines, spherical coordinate
  transformation drivers, and linear transformation subroutines

* Notes:
  WCSLIB subroutines were written by Mark Calabretta of CSIRO and have
         been modified in several ways:
         1) His distributed wcs.h has been changed to wcslib.h, and
         2) wcstrig.c subroutine names have been changed from <function>d()
            to <function>deg() to avoid name conflicts on some operating
            systems.
         3) ifndef's at start of headers files have been named to reflect
            the names of the header files, i.e. wcslib_h_ in wcslib.h.
         4) All header files have been combined into wcslib.h
	 5) Emmanuel Bertin's SCAMP distortion has been added to proj.c:1
