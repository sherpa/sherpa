WCSsubs Subroutines

These subroutines, developed as part of the WCSTools software package,
constitute a self-contained package for accessing the world coordinate
systems of FITS or IRAF(.imh) images, with image header I/O contained
in fitsfile.c and imhfile.c, and WCS initialization and use through the
subroutines in wcs.c.  WCS information for an image is kept in a single
data structure defined in wcs.h.  Pixel to WCS translations are done by
calls to pix2wcst() or pix2wcs().  WCS to pixel translations are done
by calls to wcs2pix() or wcsc2pix().  The contents of the files are
briefly described in Files.  Dependencies between these files are given
in Makefile.  Documentation, to some extent, is online at
