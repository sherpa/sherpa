\mainpage CXCDS stack library API

\section intro Introduction
This document is intended as a proposal for IRAF stack
implementation within C programs for Open--IRAF.  The
primary goal is to minimize user interaction with the
library.  IRAF stacks are not stacks in the more general
sense in Computer Science, but rather are lists or queues
commonly used to perform batch processing in IRAF.

The user of these library routines needs to create a
variable to hold the stack of type Stack.  All of the
tools to access this variable are provided in the library,
but the user will need to declare one such variable for
every stack their program uses.  This stack also marks the
user's current position in the stack so that users of the
library may choose to access the stack either via random
access or sequentially.

\section usage Usage

Users wanting to use functions in the stack lib need to

\code
#include "stack.h"
\endcode

Due to unfortunate naming this is very generic and may cause problems
when compiled against other libraries, eg STL.  Care should be taken
on the compile line to get the order of includes correct.

C++ users need to \code extern C \endcode the aforementioned header file.
