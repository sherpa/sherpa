   I am not convinced separating the models out here from the
   API below is a good idea, as we end up with multiple pages
   describing the `sherpa.astro.xspec` module (for instance).
   It seems less of an issue than I was originally worried about,
   but this should still be reviewed (in particular when looking
   at the auto-generated index or module-list pages).

.. note::

   The models in :py:mod:`sherpa.astro.xspec` are only available if
   Sherpa was built with support for the
   `XSPEC model library
   <https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/XSappendixExternal.html>`_.

This section describes the classes that implement models used
to describe and fit data, while the
:ref:`Reference/API <models-reference-api>`
section below describes the classes used to create these models.
